Photo: Christopher Anderson for New York Magazine\n\nPerhaps, at long last, a serial rapist and pedophile may be brought to justice, more than a dozen years after he was first charged with crimes that have brutalized countless girls and women. But what won\u2019t change is this: the cesspool of elites, many of them in New York, who allowed Jeffrey Epstein to flourish with impunity. For decades, important, influential, \u201cserious\u201d people attended Epstein\u2019s dinner parties, rode his private jet, and furthered the fiction that he was some kind of genius hedge-fund billionaire. How do we explain why they looked the other way, or flattered Epstein, even as they must have noticed he was often in the company of a young harem? Easy: They got something in exchange from him, whether it was a free ride on that airborne \u201cLolita Express,\u201d some other form of monetary largesse, entr\u00e9e into the extravagant celebrity soir\u00e9es he hosted at his townhouse, or, possibly and harrowingly, a pound or two of female flesh.\n\nIf you watch Fox News, you will believe Bill Clinton was Epstein\u2019s No. 1 pal and enabler. If you watch MSNBC, this scandal is usually all about Donald Trump. In fact, both presidents are guilty (at the very least) of giving Epstein cover and credibility. There are so many unanswered questions about Epstein, but one that looms over all of them is whether the bipartisan crowd who cleared a path for him will cover its tracks before we can get answers \u2014 not just Clinton and Trump and all those who drank at Epstein\u2019s trough but also (among others) institutions like Harvard, Dalton, and the Council on Foreign Relations, or lawyers like the New York prosecutor Cy Vance Jr., whose office tried to downgrade Epstein\u2019s sex-offender status; Kenneth Starr, who tried to pressure Republican Justice Department officials to keep the Epstein case from ever being prosecuted; and Alan Dershowitz, who tried to pressure the Pulitzer Prizes to shut out the Miami Herald for its epic investigative reporting that cracked open the case anew.\n\nIn 2015, Gawker published Epstein\u2019s \u201clittle black book,\u201d which had surfaced in court proceedings after a former employee took it from Epstein\u2019s home around 2005 and later tried to sell it. He said that the book had been created by people who worked for Epstein and that it contained the names and phone numbers of more than 100 victims, plus hundreds of social contacts. Along with the logs of Epstein\u2019s private plane, released in 2015, the book paints a picture of a man deeply enmeshed in the highest social circles.\n\nCollectively, these documents constitute just a glance at the way society opened itself to Epstein in New York, Hollywood, and Palm Beach. In the weeks since his arrest, we have learned even more about the cliques he traveled in and the way they protected him. Though some observers have likened Epstein\u2019s enigmatic rise as a glamorous social magnet to that of Jay Gatsby, a more appropriate archetype may be the fixer, sexual hedonist, and (ultimately disbarred) lawyer Roy Cohn. In the 1970s and early \u201980s, Cohn was a favor broker for boldface chums as various as the top Democratic-machine politicians, the mobster Carmine \u201cLilo\u201d Galante, Nancy Reagan, the proprietors of Studio 54, the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, Andy Warhol, the publishers Rupert Murdoch and Si Newhouse, Dershowitz, and the ambitious young real-estate developer Donald Trump.\n\nThis project is meant to catalogue how Epstein\u2019s secure footing in elite spheres helped hide his crimes. It includes influential names listed in his black book, people he flew, funded, and schmoozed, along with others whose connections to him have drawn renewed attention. Certainly, not everyone cited here knew of everything he was up to; Malcolm Gladwell told New York, \u201cI don\u2019t remember much except being baffled as to who this Epstein guy was and why we were all on his plane.\u201d Some said they never met Epstein at all, or knew of him only through his ex-girlfriend and alleged accomplice, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Others backed away from him after the scandal. But all of the influential people listed here were attached in some way to Epstein\u2019s world. The sum of their names constitutes a more concrete accounting of Epstein\u2019s power than could any accounting of his disputed wealth. Consider this a pointillist portrait of enablement that all too chillingly overlaps with a significant slice of the Establishment.\n\n\u2014Frank Rich\n\nHis Contacts, A to Z\n\nA guided tour of a perverse power list.\n\nAllen, Woody: Director.\n\nWith Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 2013. Photo: Elder Ordonez/Elder Ordonez/Splash News\n\nEpstein kept a photo of his friend Allen, the sexual pariah, on his wall and was photographed walking with him on the Upper East Side. They had more than a neighborhood in common. For years before his relationship with Mia Farrow, Allen had carried on with a 16-year-old girl he\u2019d met at Elaine\u2019s named Babi Christina Engelhardt. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she wondered if she was the inspiration for Manhattan, Allen\u2019s 1979 movie about a man in his 40s who dates a high-school student, which was nominated for two Academy Awards. Engelhardt had sex with Allen more than 100 times, she says, sometimes with Farrow. \u201cThe whole thing was a game that was being operated solely by Woody so we never quite knew where we stood,\u201d she said. Engelhardt went on to become Epstein\u2019s assistant.\n\nRead More: How a Predator Operated in Plain Sight\n\nAlthorp, Charles: Princess Diana\u2019s brother.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAndersson-Dubin, Dr. Eva: Doctor and former Miss Sweden.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nEpstein\u2019s ex-girlfriend and her husband, billionaire hedge-funder Glenn Dubin, had Epstein over for Thanksgiving dinner in 2009, telling his probation officer they were \u201c100 percent comfortable\u201d with his being around their teenage daughter, Insider reported. She also created a foundation so Epstein could donate to her breast-cancer charity without attaching his name. \u201cThe Dubins are horrified by the new allegations against Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cHad they been aware of the vile and unspeakable conduct described in these new allegations, they would have cut off all ties and certainly never have allowed their children to be in his presence.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, The Duke of York: Looking for a friend.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nWith Prince Andrew in Central Park in 2010. Photo: Jae Donnelly/News Licensing\n\nEpstein and the second son of Queen Elizabeth II have been friends for years and were introduced, it is generally thought, by Brit Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend and longtime aide-de-camp. Epstein has entertained the prince at his townhouse, where he would toss aside regal formalities and refer to him simply, and to English ears heretically, as \u201cAndy.\u201d Prince Andrew has had Epstein and Maxwell to shooting parties at Sandringham House, the queen\u2019s country retreat in Norfolk. Theirs is an unusual alliance, given their stations \u2014 the born royal and the Brooklyn boy who made it big \u2014 but its disparities may be part of the point. \u201cJeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time in his life,\u201d a source told Vanity Fair about the two. \u201cIt was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax.\u201d\n\nBut their relationship, and their relaxing, took on darker shades as time went on. Andrew stood by Epstein after his release from a 13-month prison sentence and was the star attraction at the party he threw to reenter society. (Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos also came.) The British press wrung its hands with equal parts pain and glee when it was discovered that Sarah, the perennially indebted Duchess of York \u2014 Fergie to her Weight Watchers fans \u2014 had accepted \u00a315,000 from Epstein to pay off one of her creditors, a deal brokered by her ex-husband, and that a former employee at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach manse had alleged in a sworn deposition that the duke was a longtime guest, enjoying massages and naked pool parties. (Prince Andrew denied ever attending, or any awareness of, naked pool parties.) The ongoing affiliation with Epstein likely contributed to the end of Andrew\u2019s duties as a U.K. trade envoy. In 2015, Virginia Roberts Giuffre alleged in a court filing that Andrew was one of the powerful friends to whom Epstein lent her out for sex. Buckingham Palace issued a statement emphatically denying the allegation. She hasn\u2019t pressed her case further in court. But a photograph of the duke with his arm around a 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre, with Maxwell grinning beside them, didn\u2019t help. \u2014Matthew Schneier\n\nAssaf, Vittorio: Restaurateur.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nStarted the Upper East Side institution Serafina.\n\nBand, Doug: Influence peddler.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nA onetime White House intern who climbed his way to being Bill Clinton\u2019s bag carrier, body man, fixer, and all-purpose gatekeeper, Band arranged for the former president to travel to Africa on Epstein\u2019s 727 in 2002. Band would go on to help his boss found the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, a choice platform from which he launched his own lucrative favor-trading corporate-advisory firm, Teneo. Throughout that time, he took a number of trips on Epstein\u2019s plane and attended parties at his townhouse. Band resigned from his position at CGI in 2012; leaked emails later showed Band and Chelsea Clinton trading accusations of conflicts of interest in a war of influence over her parents. More recently, Band\u2019s been teaching a \u201cPublic Service\u201d class at NYU.\n\nRead More: Everything We Know About Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side Mansion\n\nBalazs, Andr\u00e9: Celebrity hotelier.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBaldwin, Alec: Actor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDenies knowing Epstein, though he appears in the black book. Recently, Baldwin invited Julie K. Brown, the Miami Herald reporter who resurfaced the Epstein story, to do a podcast.\n\nBannon, Steve: Former White House chief strategist.\n\nIn August 2018, the New York Post reported that Bannon had been seen entering Epstein\u2019s townhouse. Neither Bannon nor Epstein has commented on the substance of their meeting, but when Ivanka Trump condemned Roy Moore\u2019s campaign in Alabama, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children,\u201d Bannon, who backed Moore, responded, \u201cWhat about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\u201d It was a clear reference to the woman who had accused Donald Trump and Epstein of raping her when she was 13.\n\nBarr, Donald: The headmaster who offered entr\u00e9e.\n\nIn the 1975 Dalton School yearbook. Photo: The Dalton School\n\nBarr was ousted shortly before Epstein, 21 and without a college degree, showed up for his first day of work teaching math and physics at the Manhattan\u2019s elite Dalton School in the early 1970s. Barr announced his resignation soon after, in February 1974: \u201cHe was disliked by the faculty, he was highly controversial, he hadn\u2019t raised much money, he was very conservative,\u201d said the board\u2019s chairman. Barr\u2019s leadership style was described as \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d at the time. Memorably, several former students told the New York Times that Epstein was overly familiar with teenage girls at the school. Donald\u2019s son William would intersect with Epstein\u2019s orbit while serving as a counsel at Kirkland and Ellis in 2009. The law firm secured Epstein his obscenely lenient 2007 non-prosecution deal, which the Justice Department is now reviewing. In July, Barr the son refused to recuse himself from the ongoing Epstein investigation.\n\nBarrack, Tom: Trump adviser and private-equity manager.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nIn Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff wrote that Trump, Epstein, and Barrack were a \u201cset of nightlife musketeers\u201d in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\nBerger, Sandy: National-security adviser for Bill Clinton.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBerggruen, Nicolas: Billionaire investor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBerkman, Bill: New York businessman.\n\nNames found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nA wealthy executive whose family established the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard, Berkman was sued in 2014 by his administrative assistant, who said she was forced to read emails Berkman had sent to a colleague containing \u201cpictures of random and unsuspecting women on the street\u201d \u2014 that is, creepshots.

Vicky Ward, who profiled Epstein for Vanity Fair in 2003, said Epstein heavily leaned on Black, who is her ex-husband\u2019s uncle (and was her ex-husband\u2019s then-boss), to try to exert his influence on Ward.\n\nBlack, Leon: Private-equity tycoon.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management and chairman of MoMA, Black made Epstein the director of his family foundation in 2001. The foundation continued to list Epstein as director on its tax forms until 2012, four years after he had pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. The foundation now says that Epstein resigned in 2007 and that his name continued to appear on its rolls owing to a \u201crecording error.\u201d In 2011, he was listed as an investor in Environmental Solutions Worldwide, a Pennsylvania company, alongside several people close to Black, including his four children. Black himself was seen with Epstein at a movie screening just a few months after Epstein finished probation in 2010, and Epstein was spotted at a party at Black\u2019s home in the Hamptons as recently as 2015.\n\nBlack, Roy: An Epstein lawyer.\n\nThe trial attorney and legal analyst\u2019s client roster has included Justin Bieber, Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, and Rush Limbaugh. Black is perhaps best known for representing William Kennedy Smith against rape charges in Palm Beach in 1991. (The Kennedy nephew was acquitted.) In 2005, Black played the \u201cmanaging partner\u201d on NBC\u2019s The Law Firm, a knockoff of The Apprentice for up-and-coming lawyers.\n\nBlaine, David: Magician.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBlaine put on a private show for Epstein\u2019s dinner guests in 2003, doing card tricks for the likes of Sergey Brin, Mort Zuckerman, and Bill Clinton aide Doug Band.

Bolkiah and his brother are famous for their lavish spending, including a collection of 2,500 cars and a $1.5 billion palace. Bolkiah was once sued by Miss USA 1997, who claimed she had been held as a sex slave. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that Bolkiah had sovereign immunity.\n\nBond, Annabelle: British socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBonomi, Andrea: Italian businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe chairman and founder of Investindustrial was a key character in the Paradise Papers international tax-shelter scandal.\n\nBorrico, Michael: Long Island contractor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDescribed by Social Life magazine as the \u201cambassador of the all-important Hamptons polo culture,\u201d Borrico is known for hosting polo matches at his estate in Water Mill.\n\nBourke, Frederic: A founder of Dooney & Bourke.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBourke went to prison for a scheme to bribe government officials in Azerbaijan.\n\nBowles, Hamish: European editor-at-large for Vogue.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBrandolini, Muriel: Interior designer.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nHer clients have included Matt Lauer and the Crown Prince and Princess of Greece.\n\nBranson, Richard: Founder of Virgin Group.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nLike Epstein, Branson enjoys entertaining on a private island.\n\nBriatore, Flavio: Italian millionaire businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nA friend of Trump, a convicted card cheat, and an accused Formula 1 race fixer, Briatore was a longtime fugitive in the Virgin Islands.\n\nBrockman, John: Agent for scientific \u201cfreethinkers.\u201d\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFrom left, John Brockman, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, Katinka Matson, and Richard Dawkins flying to a TED conference in 2002 aboard Epstein's plane, pictured below Photo: Dailymail.com.

All men, of course. But the group selfies probably shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise \u2014 documents of an age in which every millionaire doesn\u2019t just fancy himself a philosopher-king but expects to be treated as such, and every public intellectual wants to be seen as a kind of celebrity.\n\nCultural shifts like these require visionaries, networkers, salespeople. Brockman is one. A Warhol Factory kid turned freelance philosopher of science turned literary agent to Dawkins and Dennett and Pinker (and many others), in the 1980s he formed a casual salon of like-minded scientists and futurists that came to be known as the Reality Club, a knock against the poststructuralism then dominant in the academy. In the 1990s, he rebranded it as the Edge Foundation, an organization whose central event was an annual online symposium devoted to a single, broad question. In 2000, it was \u201cWhat is today\u2019s most important underreported story?\u201d In 2006, \u201cWhat is your dangerous idea?\u201d\n\nEpstein was a regular contributor, and his plane \u2014 to judge from the photographs, at least \u2014 was an especially appealing way for other contributors to get to ted. They could also catch Epstein at Harvard, where so many of them taught and where he became so prolific a donor that one whole academic program seemed to be run like his private Renaissance ateliers. Epstein had long described himself as a \u201cscientific philanthropist,\u201d and in a press release put out by the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation announcing its \u201csubstantial backing\u201d of Edge, he called it \u201cthe world\u2019s smartest think tank.\u201d\n\nMany in Brockman\u2019s Edge community are, or were, inarguably significant figures in the American intellectual Establishment: Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond, Craig Venter, John Horgan, Paul Bloom (to name a random but representative sample). They are also among the gods and heroes of the Trump-era internet community of \u201cfreethinkers,\u201d whom Eric Weinstein, the venture capitalist and regular Edge contributor, memorably called \u201cthe intellectual dark web.\u201d The name suggests a self-glamorizing style of dangerous discourse, and as soon as the community was identified, it was criticized as revanchist, an effort to reopen areas of intellectual inquiry \u2014 about innate differences between the races, say, or the genders \u2014 now considered problematic, at a minimum. But to listen to the IDW warriors themselves \u2014 talking about the \u201cwar on free speech\u201d as though their universities had sent assassins their way rather than tenured chairs \u2014 their crusade seems motivated just as much by a thin-skinned sense of their own world-historical significance. They were special people, deserving of special acclaim and, of course, special privileges.\n\nMany contributions to Edge were plausibly the products of genuinely special minds. Epstein\u2019s were not. In 2008, the year he went to jail for prostitution, the prompt was \u201cWhat have you changed your mind about?\u201d Epstein replied, \u201cThe question presupposes a well defined \u2018you\u2019 and an implied ability that is under \u2018your\u2019 control to change your \u2018mind.\u2019 The \u2018you\u2019 I now believe is distributed amongst others (family friends, in hierarchal structures), i.e. suicide bombers, believe their sacrifice is for the other parts of their \u2018you.\u2019 The question carries with it an intention that I believe is out of one\u2019s control. My mind changed as a result of its interaction with its environment. Why? Because it is a part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeffrey has the mind of a physicist,\u201d the Harvard professor Martin Nowak has said, incredibly. But what he really did have was the life of a very rich person \u2014 unable to see any world he felt unqualified to enter and surrounded by too many people enamored with his money to ever hear the word no. \u2014David Wallace-Wells\n\nBronfman Jr., Edgar: Executive.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe former Warner Music Group CEO, son of the late Seagram\u2019s CEO Edgar Bronfman Sr., is related to the NXIVM-sex-cult Bronfmans. His son has a child with pop star M.I.A.\n\nBrunel, Jean-Luc: Model scout.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBrunel was accused in court testimony of having used his agency to supply Epstein with girls. (He was not charged.) He also has a long history of allegations that he had abused his fashion-world position. In 1988, he was the subject of a 60 Minutes investigation alleging that he and a fellow agent sexually assaulted nearly two dozen models. He denied the claims but later told Model author Michael Gross, \u201cYou get laid tonight with a model, is that a crime?\u201d In 2005, Brunel co-founded the Mc2 modeling agency; Epstein invested $1 million, according to a 2010 deposition.\n\nBuck, Joan Juliet: Fashion editor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nIn 2003, Buck met Maxwell at a fashion party at a New York City boutique. Buck had recently moved on from her seven-year tenure as the editor of Paris Vogue and was writing for its American counterpart and living in New Mexico. She was a lifelong resident of a rarefied social world. Maxwell, a regular on that particular circuit, quickly made a connection. \u201cOh, Jeffrey\u2019s got a ranch in Santa Fe, blah blah blah,\u201d Buck recently remembered their conversation going. She gave Maxwell her Santa Fe number and later asked a friend about Epstein and New Mexico. \u201cHis ranch?\u201d the friend replied. \u201cAs we say in Texas, all hat, no cattle.\u201d\n\nBurkle, Ron: Supermarket magnate.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nBurkle took what were described as humanitarian trips to Africa with Bill Clinton on Epstein\u2019s private Boeing 727. According to a 2008 Vanity Fair feature about the former president, \u201cBurkle\u2019s usual means of transport is the custom-converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls \u2018Ron Air\u2019 and that Burkle\u2019s own circle of young aides privately refer to as \u2018Air Fuck One.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBushnell, Candace: Columnist who inspired Sex and the City.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nBusson, Arpad: French financier.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDuring a custody battle with ex Uma Thurman, her lawyer asked Busson, a prominent hedge-funder, if he had ever said he was \u201caddicted to prostitutes.\u201d (He said no.)\n\nCalacanis, Jason: Businessman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAn investor in Uber, Calacanis was a fixture in the early-aughts New York tech scene as the founder and editor of Silicon Alley Reporter. (\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many propositions I get, it\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d he told the Observer in 2000.) In 2014, Vice awarded him Most Offensive Tweet of the Year for describing as racist the idea of white privilege.\n\nCaledon, Nicky: Earl.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nCampbell, Naomi: Supermodel.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nCandy, Nicholas and Christian: British property-developer brothers.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nCarter, Graydon: Former editor of Vanity Fair.\n\nAccording to journalist Vicky Ward, he killed portions of a 2003 story that accused Epstein of pedophilia after an office visit from Epstein. (Carter says there wasn\u2019t enough on-the-record sourcing.) \u201cI didn\u2019t invent the system. I just lived by the system,\u201d he said when The New York Times Magazine questioned him about the story last week.\n\nCecil, Aurelia: PR chairman.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAllegedly the former girlfriend of Prince Andrew.\n\nCecil, Mark: Hedge-funder.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nHas hosted Prince William and Kate Middleton at his villa in Mustique.\n\nChatwal, Vikram: Hotelier.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWhen the 1990s playboy settled down, Bill Clinton attended his wedding.

Photo: Christopher Anderson for New York Magazine\n\nClinton, Bill: President and problem.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nAs soon as the Epstein news broke two weeks ago, the taunting and tallying began, suffocating in its familiarity. First were the jeering reminders, as if we didn\u2019t know it in our every molecule: It wasn\u2019t just Donald Trump who\u2019d be ensnared in this stygian nightmare of underage sexual assault and trafficking of girls, it was Bill Clinton, who\u2019d been a friend and repeat flier on Epstein\u2019s plane. Then came the numbers, the attempts to quantify the nature of the Clinton-Epstein relationship. Clinton issued a statement toting up four plane trips, one Epstein meeting in Clinton\u2019s Harlem office, one visit to Epstein\u2019s home, and zero trips to his island. Meanwhile, reporters recalled that Gawker\u2019s published flight logs had tallied 12 separate plane legs and that Epstein had more than 20 numbers and email addresses for Clinton and one signed photo of him in his home, along with one of Woody Allen and one of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll of this was presented as if these numbers could clarify some exact science of guilt or complicity. The reality is: Yes, Clinton was grimy and had grimy friends, and, more broadly, this is how powerful men have behaved toward women and one another. Yes, we know it\u2019s dirty and mean and exhausting and true.\n\nWe know, of course, because the shadow of Clinton\u2019s sexual history and his associations with other men who have terrible legacies of sexually inappropriate-to-criminal behavior have for decades hung like a greasy and unscrubbable film over the Democratic Party he once led. Clinton palled around not just with Epstein but with Charlie Rose and Harvey Weinstein and Trump himself.\n\nThey hung out together and flew together and went to each other\u2019s offices and visited each other\u2019s homes and appeared on each other\u2019s TV shows and had each other\u2019s phone numbers and attended each other\u2019s weddings and created a circle of money and protection. The prosecutorial and defensive math \u2014 the haggling over flights and phone numbers \u2014 is just used to complicate this basic reality.\n\nThose on the left have been going over how we\u2019re supposed to feel about him for decades, but in the arguing about it, we have been asked to focus again and again on Clinton and his dick and what he did or didn\u2019t do with it. The questions we\u2019ve asked ourselves and one another have become defining.\n\nAre we morally compromised in our defense of him or sexually uptight in our condemnation? Are we shills for having not believed he should have resigned, or doing the bidding of a vindictive right wing if we say that, in retrospect, he probably should have?\n\nMeanwhile, how much energy and time have been spent circling round this man and how we\u2019ve felt about him, when in fact his behaviors were symptomatic of far broader and more damaging assumptions about men, power, and access to \u2014 as Trump has so memorably voiced it \u2014 pussies?\n\nAfter all, Clinton was elected president during a period that may turn out to be an aberration, just as the kinds of dominating, sexually aggressive behaviors that had been norms for his West Wing predecessors had become officially unacceptable, and 24 years before those behaviors would again become a presidential norm. So yes, Clinton got in trouble, yet still managed to sail out of office beloved by many, his reputation as the Big Dog mostly only enhanced by revelations of his exploits.\n\nBut the election of Trump over Clinton\u2019s wife, and the broad conversation around sexual assault and harassment that has erupted in its wake, has recast his behavior more profoundly. The buffoonery, the smallness and tantrums of Trump, has helped make clear what always should have been: that the out-of-control behavior toward women by powerful men, the lack of self-control or amount of self-regard that undergirded their reckless treatment of women, spoke not of virility or authority but of their immaturity. And the people who have paid the biggest price for these men\u2019s fixation on sex as a measure of manhood have, of course, not been the men themselves.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, it has been Monica Lewinsky, whose life and name became defined by her relationship to him. It has been his wife, Hillary, who, in addition to having been celebrated and pilloried for her defense of her husband, also had to conduct one of her three historic presidential debates with women who\u2019d accused him of sexual misconduct sitting in the audience, invited there by her opponent as props to unsettle and disempower her. It has been decades of left feminist women who have had Clinton\u2019s misdeeds thrown in our faces as proof of our own hypocrisy.\n\nI try sometimes to imagine a contemporary Democratic Party without Bill Clinton in its recent past \u2014 yes, of course, from a policy perspective, but also simply from a personal one. What if so much energy had not been eaten up by his colleagues, by his wife, by feminists, by his supporters and friends and critics, all of whom had to dance around him, explain their associations with him, or carefully lay out their objections to him without coming off as frigid reactionaries?\n\nWhat else might we have done with our politics had we not been worrying about Clinton and his grubby buddies? What further power have they taken from us? \u2014Rebecca Traister\n\nClinton, Chelsea: First Daughter.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell attended her wedding after Epstein had first been charged.

Photo: Rick Friedman/Polaris\n\nFor around a decade, Dershowitz kept casual company with Epstein, who introduced him to his friends, like Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew.\n\n(Dershowitz says he and the prince ended up not getting along because they disagreed about Israel.) Dershowitz visited Epstein\u2019s mansions in New York and Palm Beach and occasionally accompanied him on his private plane. He says these trips were family oriented. Once, Epstein lent him the Palm Beach home so he could attend a granddaughter\u2019s soccer tournament. Another time, he and his nephew flew down to watch a space launch with another Epstein connection, a top NASA official. He and his wife, Carolyn Cohen, once stayed with Epstein on his island in the Caribbean, where they were joined by another Harvard professor and his family.\n\nWhen Epstein first started to attract media attention in the early aughts, mainly because of his friendship with former president Bill Clinton, Dershowitz served as a character witness for the reclusive financier.\n\nHe told Vanity Fair that he shared manuscripts of his books with Epstein before they were published and swore that his money was irrelevant. \u201cI would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\nBut Dershowitz says their interactions changed in 2005, when Epstein faced a local police investigation into his relations with underage girls in Palm Beach and he hired Dershowitz as a lawyer. With his assistance, Epstein was able to whittle down the state\u2019s indictment against him to a single count of soliciting prostitution. But in the years to come, as Epstein\u2019s legal problems compounded, they would eventually ensnare Dershowitz himself. He is also accused of having sex with two of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims. \u201cThe stories are so phantasmological,\u201d Dershowitz says. He recognizes that the #MeToo movement has surfaced countless accounts of preposterous-sounding sexual misbehavior by powerful men and almost all of them have turned out to be true. But Dershowitz swears he is different. \u201cMine is the only case, singular, the only one, where I never met the people,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence we\u2019ve ever met, no evidence we were ever in the same place at the same time, ever.\u201d\n\nToday, Dershowitz claims he and Epstein were never really even friends, despite their proximity. \u201cHe was an acquaintance,\u201d he says. \u201cIn retrospect, I wish I hadn\u2019t taken the case, but I didn\u2019t see a problem with taking the case. We didn\u2019t have a close personal relationship.\u201d \u2014Andrew Rice\n\nRead More: Alan Dershowitz Cannot Stop Talking\n\nDickinson, Janice: Model, actress, TV personality.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDiniz, Pedro: Agroforester, businessman, former Formula 1 racing driver.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDriver, Minnie: Actress.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDunbar-Johnson, Stephen: President, international, of the New York Times Company.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nDunne, Griffin: Director.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nJoan Didion\u2019s nephew and a Martin Scorsese leading man.\n\nEdelman, Gerald: Nobel Prize winner.\n\nEdelman received funding from the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation. \u201cJeff is extraordinary in his ability to pick up on quantitative relations,\u201d he told New York in 2002. \u201cHe came to see us recently.

He came from a modest Coney Island background, had no college degree, and worked a job \u2014 as a math teacher at Dalton and a tutor to Greenberg\u2019s son \u2014 that was unlikely to support his tastes, which were apparently of the private islands\u2013and\u2013gilded desk\u2013purportedly\u2013belonging\u2013to\u2013J. P. Morgan variety. At Bear Stearns, Epstein made a name for himself in the \u201cspecial-products division,\u201d essentially figuring out how to help the rich pay less taxes. \u201cHe would recommend certain tax-advantageous transactions,\u201d Greenberg\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, James \u201cJimmy\u201d Cayne, told New York in 2002. Cayne, who succeeded Greenberg in 1993, seems to have become the closer party to Epstein, whose mysterious departure from the firm he publicly defended decades after Epstein\u2019s departure. \u201cJeffrey said specifically, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself,\u2019 \u201d Cayne insisted, despite transcripts from an SEC deposition that suggest other concerns around them both. It\u2019s easier to imagine Cayne, a cigar-chomping, archetypal fat cat who was infamously off playing bridge when Bear Stearns collapsed in 2008, as a member of Epstein\u2019s inner circle than his mentor, a folksy, bow-tie-wearing soul who referred to his successor as \u201ccrude,\u201d \u201cfull of himself,\u201d and \u201cwarped\u201d in a memoir published shortly before his death. At the very least, it seems Cayne and Epstein were both capable of, ah, massaging the truth. \u2014Jessica Pressler\n\nGuest, Cornelia: Socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nShe was dubbed \u201cdebutante of the decade\u201d in 1986.\n\nGutfreund, John: CEO of Salomon Brothers.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nHamilton, George: Actor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe overtanned C-lister that Hollywood turns to when casting any vaguely and/or mysteriously aristocratic cameo role.\n\nHandler, Chelsea: Comedian.\n\nAttended a dinner at Epstein\u2019s townhouse for Prince Andrew in 2010. \u201cIt was just one of those strange nights,\u201d she later said.\n\nHaskell, Nikki: Socialite.\n\nEpstein dated Haskell, one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest friends. \u201cJeffrey didn\u2019t talk about his past, although he claimed to have been a concert pianist,\u201d Haskell told the Daily Mail in 1992. \u201cHe told me he was a spy hired by corporations to find major amounts of money which had been embezzled.\u201d\n\nHawking, Stephen: Physicist.\n\nIn 2006, the world\u2019s most famous brain visited Little St. James, Epstein\u2019s private island, which came to be known as \u201cPedophile Island.\u201d Hawking, who was in the Caribbean for a conference, was photographed at a barbecue on the island and aboard a submarine for a tour.

He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and, after his release in 2013, began sounding the alarm on Epstein, who had worked at Hoffenberg\u2019s Towers Financial Corporation after leaving Bear Stearns. He claimed that Epstein had been his co-conspirator in the scheme and that Epstein\u2019s fortune was built on Towers Financial\u2019s fraud. \u201cHe was great at moving money illegally,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cHe was the deeper architect to getting things accomplished.\u201d\n\nHoffenberg claims he was introduced to Epstein by Douglas Leese, a mysterious British arms dealer, and that he paid Epstein $25,000 a month as Towers Financial began making risky plays to take over companies like Pan American World Airways and Emery Air Freight. Advisers on the Pan Am deal included Richard Nixon\u2019s attorney general John Mitchell, Nixon\u2019s brother Edward, and John Lehman, a former secretary of the Navy. The move fell apart after the Lockerbie bombing, and when Towers Financial later went belly-up, Hoffenberg says, the two of them engineered a Ponzi scheme to fill the hole.\n\n\u201cHe has a magnificent personality,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cHe\u2019s very easy to interact with, very social, very easy to bond with, an unusually nice person. And he\u2019s pretty dynamic on financial savvy. He could move money in different areas to get the stock prices to go up and down.\u201d\n\nHoffenberg still owes his victims some $1 billion in restitution, and in 2016 he sued Epstein to recover some of the money. (He eventually dropped the suit.) Last year, two victims brought a suit against Epstein making the same claims as Hoffenberg but voluntarily dismissed the suit two months later.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to see an entire story about this supposed billionaire and the story about his financial empire, which is as big as the tragedy with the girls,\u201d Hoffenberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s billions of dollars, and it\u2019s a fiasco.\u201d \u2014James D.

Was it money? Probably. The word is that Epstein paid his \u201cexecutive assistants\u201d $200,000 a year and let them order takeout from Le Cirque. When Groff had a baby, Epstein gave her a Mercedes and paid for a full-time nanny. \u201cThere is no way I could lose Lesley to motherhood,\u201d he told the New York Times in 2005 (for a front-page story on the indispensability of good help for Wall Street tycoons).\n\nMarcinkova, referred to in court documents as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave,\u201d hails from the former Yugoslavia; Ross, a model, is from Poland. Kellen (who has since married a NASCAR driver) was a scheduler, making sure that Epstein always had a slate full of girls, and it was she who sometimes walked the girls up the stairs in the Florida mansion and laid the oils out on the massage table. Marcinkova would have sex with the girls for Epstein\u2019s viewing pleasure and sometimes all together. Groff booked travel, and Ross also helped with the calendar. After the Miami Herald published its investigation in 2018, Epstein wired the \u201cpossible co-conspirators\u201d $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, prosecutors say, to buy their silence. Since then, none of them have been reached for comment. \u2014Lisa Miller\n\nKennedy, Ethel: Human-rights advocate.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWidow of Robert Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, Ted: Senator.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nEpstein had his home number.\n\nKent, Geoffrey: High-end safari entrepreneur.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nKerry, John: Secretary of State.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe seven numbers listed for Kerry in Epstein\u2019s address book include the direct line to his presidential campaign.\n\nKhashoggi, Adnan: Saudi Arabian man of mystery.\n\nTo bolster their argument that private-jet owner Epstein is a massive flight risk, SDNY prosecutors produced an expired Austrian passport under an alias that listed Saudi Arabia as Epstein\u2019s primary country of residence. His lawyers claim the fake ID was for the \u201cpersonal protection\u201d of \u201can affluent member of the Jewish faith\u201d traveling in the Middle East, but it could also point to one of his more secretive income sources.\n\nAccording to his former friend the journalist Jesse Kornbluth, in the mid-1980s Epstein said he \u201cworked for governments to recover money looted by African dictators\u201d and occasionally subcontracted to those same autocrats to \u201chelp them hide their stolen money.\u201d A source who spoke with journalist Vicky Ward said one of Epstein\u2019s clients was the late Saudi arms dealer Khashoggi, a middleman in the Iran-Contra scandal who helped smuggle cash for the Marcos family out of the Philippines. In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland for concealing assets and later faced fraud and racketeering charges in the U.S. (He was later acquitted.) That year, he sold his 282-foot yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who soon flipped it to Donald Trump. \u2014Matt Stieb\n\nKissinger, Henry: Secretary of State and national-security adviser.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nOne of the century\u2019s most notorious practitioners of cutthroat realpolitik, Kissinger served on the Council on Foreign Relations with Epstein.\n\nKissinger, Nancy: Philanthropist.\n\nEpstein and Kissinger served on the Rockefeller University board alongside Nobel laureate Joseph Goldstein, socialite Brooke Astor, and Texas billionaire Robert Bass.\n\nKleman, Leah: Art dealer.\n\nShe told Vanity Fair in 2003 that Epstein lived like a \u201cmodern maharaja\u201d and described his haggling over art prices as \u201csomething like a scene out of the movie Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.\u201d\n\nKoch, David: Plutocrat.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nKosslyn, Stephen: Harvard psychologist.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\n\u201cHe is amazing,\u201d Kosslyn said of Epstein in a 2002 New York profile. \u201cLike a honeybee \u2014 he talks to all these different people and cross-pollinates.

She was a friend of everyone, if an intimate of few.\n\nMaxwell seemed to know many rich and powerful men \u2014 articles mention her dining with Bill Clinton, photos show her partying with Elon Musk and deep in conversation with Stephen Schwarzman \u2014 but her most durable connection has been with Epstein. She was, as he once put it, his \u201cbest friend.\u201d Maxwell, 57, has been accused in civil suits of serving as his procuress, luring women and girls into Epstein\u2019s web.\n\nIn court documents, Epstein\u2019s accusers allege that Maxwell \u2014 who denies all and has never been criminally charged \u2014 acted as a recruiter, an instructor, and in some cases a participant in the abuse he practiced. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Maxwell recruited her on behalf of Epstein when Giuffre was a 16-year-old spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where Epstein has a home, said much of her grooming came from Maxwell. \u201cThe training started immediately,\u201d Giuffre said in a video interview with the Miami Herald. \u201cIt was everything down to how to give a blow job, how to be quiet, be subservient, give Jeffrey what he wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery pretty girl in New York, in those days, Ghislaine would invite to Jeffrey\u2019s,\u201d said Euan Rellie, an investment banker and social fixture who has known Maxwell for years and who, along with his wife, the author and socialite Lucy Sykes, was a fellow guest at a dinner for Prince Andrew at Epstein\u2019s townhouse in the early aughts. Maxwell and Epstein had been attached, but she was \u201cnow an employee of his, as I understood it,\u201d Rellie said. \u201cHer job was to jazz up his social life by getting fashionable young women to show up.\u201d He presumed the young women to be in their 20s.\n\nTabloid reports on Maxwell claim she managed Epstein\u2019s properties from his office on Madison Avenue, which appeared in public records for many years as one of Maxwell\u2019s addresses. Epstein, for his part, said she wasn\u2019t on the payroll, yet she did errands for him: hunted for a yoga teacher in California and acted as intermediary when he wanted to give his friend the billionaire Les Wexner a family portrait painted by Nelson Shanks.\n\nShe was said to be wickedly funny and unusually knowledgeable, glamorous, and, on top of that, British. (\u201cI think New Yorkers are charmed by that high-end English accent,\u201d photographer Patrick McMullan said.)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she was exotic. She had explored the seas and could pilot a helicopter, or maybe a submarine, one acquaintance thought \u2014 a MacGyver of the gala circuit.\n\nMaxwell arrived in New York in the early \u201990s, on the cusp of her 30th birthday. English-born and poshly educated, she was the favorite daughter of Robert Maxwell, the English media mogul, whose holdings included newspapers, notably the tabloid Daily Mirror in London, and the Macmillan publishing house in the U.S. Ghislaine had founded a social club for women in London and worked for another of her father\u2019s papers, and, according to the New York Post, she came as his emissary to American society when he bought the New York Daily News in 1991.\n\nBut that same year, Robert was found dead \u2014 by suicide, murder, or accident (the official inquest\u2019s ruling, though opinions vary) \u2014 in the Atlantic, off the Canary Islands. (He was last seen on the deck of his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.) Soon after, he was discovered to have plundered the pension funds of the Mirror to shore up his floundering empire. Ghislaine was reported to have an income for life from a family trust, but at \u00a380,000 a year, it would hardly be enough to sustain a high-flying lifestyle.\n\nThe meet-cute of Epstein and Maxwell in New York is unclear, and neither has historically gone into any great detail. By 1992, they were already linked, showing up at a Mar-a-Lago party with each other in Palm Beach, where Trump and Epstein ogled women together in front of NBC cameras. Suffice it to say they were romantically linked and then platonically linked. (Epstein told people his former paramours move \u201cup, not down,\u201d to friend status.)\n\nFor a woman seen everywhere about town, she is curiously silent in the press, except where ocean conservation is concerned. In 2008, she hosted a cocktail party for the board of the nonprofit Oceana at her townhouse on East 65th Street. And by 2012, she had launched the TerraMar Project, a conservation nonprofit of her own, of which, according to tax filings, she was president but from which she drew no salary. She gave a ted Talk about its work and talked it up at the U.N. and in the press, which credited TerraMar as her \u201cbrainchild.\u201d\n\nFrom the New York social world, she has vanished. \u201cI have not seen her in a zillion years,\u201d one acquaintance said. The party photos dried up in 2016. Her 65th Street townhouse was sold for just over $15 million that year. Where is she now? One social-watcher guessed the islands; others think Europe. She incorporated a company \u2014 Ellmax, a play on her name \u2014 in the U.K., and TerraMar\u2019s last two years of tax filings listed the address of an accounting firm near Boston. (An executive there declined to provide any forwarding information.)\n\n\u201cShe seemed like a woman who didn\u2019t have any real job, didn\u2019t have any real boyfriend, had lost her dad,\u201d Rellie said of his impressions of her when they\u2019d met. \u201cA woman adrift who was clinging on to whatever she could find.\u201d \u2014Matthew Schneier\n\nRead More: The Socialite on Epstein\u2019s Arm\n\nMcMullan, Patrick: Photographer.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nMeister, Robert: Insurance executive.\n\nIntroduced Epstein to Leslie Wexner after Epstein met and charmed Meister on a plane to Palm Beach, according to James Patterson\u2019s book Filthy Rich.\n\nRead More: Author James Patterson on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u2018Unbelievable\u2019 Crimes\n\nMinsky, Marvin: MIT professor and pioneer of artificial intelligence.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nMitchell, George: Senate majority leader.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe former senator was appointed the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland by President Clinton and was an architect of the Good Friday Agreement.

Despite what various friends and colleagues all said about what a genius he was, I found him tedious and distasteful. Even before I knew about the criminality, I found it irritating to talk to him, all the more so because the reason he was in the conversation was because he had given money to these various projects. He likes schmoozing with smart and intellectual people, but he couldn\u2019t really or had very little interest in exploring an issue. He\u2019d wisecrack, change subjects, or get bored after a few seconds. He\u2019s a kibitzer more than a serious intellectual.\u201d Nevertheless, Pinker supplied some linguistic expertise that his friend Alan Dershowitz used to defend Epstein during the 2008 trial. \u2014Matt Stieb\n\nPinto, Alberto: Interior designer for the gold-leaf life.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nForget for a moment the mural featuring Epstein in the middle of a prison yard complete with guards and barbed wire. Let\u2019s also forget the life-size doll hanging from a chandelier, and the chess set with figures of his staff as pieces to play with. Let\u2019s instead focus on the very lush Euro-Orientalist d\u00e9cor of Epstein\u2019s 21,000-square-foot seven-story Beaux-Arts mansion, decorated by none other than the late great Alberto Pinto, one of the world\u2019s top prestige interior designers. His clientele included princes, moguls, and wannabe princes, as captains of industry so frequently are, and Epstein clearly aspired to that provenance and history. He flew Pinto on his private plane, as he did other architects and designers (Jean-Michel Gathy, Ricardo Legorreta, and Peter Marino are also listed in Epstein\u2019s flight logs), and lived like a modern pasha in rooms lavished with money that bought custom-tooled gold leather walls (at least they were made to look like tooled-leather walls) and leopard-print upholstered armchairs in the dining room that appear to be covered in silk velvet. It was exactly the sort of project Pinto relished, flexing all the artisanal muscle that a designer of his stature can exercise when cushioning his client\u2019s home. \u2014Wendy Goodman\n\nPittman, Bob: Chairman and CEO of iHeartMedia, Inc.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nPosen, Felix: Philanthropist\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nFormer business partner of Marc Rich (who was famously indicted for tax evasion and trading with Iran, before being even more famously pardoned by President Clinton), with whom he paired on deals in the Soviet Union before the fall of communism.\n\nPritzker, Tom: Executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nKnown to dine with Epstein in the early aughts.\n\nRadziwill, Carole: Author and television personality.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe daughter-in-law of Lee Radziwill and a Real Housewife of New York.\n\nRanieri, Lewis: The \u201cfather\u201d of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAnother Epstein dinner partner.\n\nRichardson, Bill: Former New Mexico governor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nZorro Ranch, Epstein\u2019s New Mexico property.

Written call logs from 2005 and 2006 show Epstein and his own assistant calling dozens of times, making plans for lunch and tea in Manhattan or to try to meet up in Paris. Epstein also called with a total of five women\u2019s names and phone numbers. One woman was described as \u201cworld\u2019s most perfect assistant she used to work for Harvey Weinstein he\u2019s lucky if he can get her.\u201d Another entry reads, \u201cJeffrey Epstein wants to talk to you before you call these two girls.\u201d A fourth woman shows up on the manifests of Epstein\u2019s jet, including on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip across Africa, and wound up working at the Clinton Foundation. Two former staffers remember another Epstein referral, a young woman not mentioned in the logs, who interned at the show. In all, Rose hired three (\u201cJeffrey Epstein from time to time recommended various candidates for open positions at the Charlie Rose Show,\u201d Rose\u2019s representative said in a statement, but said the ex-host only learned about Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse years later, when he pleaded guilty in Florida). When I called one of these women recently, she was stunned to learn she was one of many women Epstein recommended for the job. \u201cI was being offered up for abuse,\u201d said the woman, who was 22 at the time she worked for Rose. It helped her understand not only how her boss Rose \u2014 whom in 2017 she would accuse, along with 34 other adult women, of sexual harassment \u2014 had treated her, but also how the rest of the staff had seen her. And it helped her understand a grim version of networking among powerful men. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nSacco, Amy: Nightlife impresario.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nThe undisputed club queen of aughts New York, Sacco ran Lot 61 in Chelsea, which was famous for using fresh fruit in its drinks, and later Bungalow 8, which prided itself on discretion, the kind of place where celebrities could behave badly and not have to worry about appearing in \u201cPage Six.\u201d Sacco was a pioneer of marrying nightlife with concierge-style indulgences for the very rich: Her staff would get you whatever you needed: pizza delivery, peanut M&M\u2019s, a private flight to Miami leaving from Teterboro as soon as you could get there.\n\nSchank, Roger: Chief learning officer at Trump University.\n\nVisited Epstein in prison in 2008.\n\nSchumer, Chuck: New York\u2019s senior senator.\n\nOne of many politicians to receive donations from Epstein over the years. Epstein gave bipartisanly but not equally: Between 1990 and 2004, he gave more than $139,000 to Democrats and just over $18,000 to Republicans. Epstein also gave to a handful of politicians in New Mexico, where he\u2019d purchase the Zorro Ranch from former governor Bruce King and where he was not required to register as a sex offender. In recent weeks, politicians including Schumer decided to donate an equal amount to charity.\n\nShriver, Maria: Journalist and former First Lady of California.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nTwo California numbers are listed in the address book.\n\nSiegal, Peggy: Elite New York\u2019s glue.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nA brazen and relentless publicist of the old school, Siegal understands one thing well: \u201cBringing people together. Everyone needs to feel that they belong.\u201d At least a certain kind of accomplished person, no matter, frankly, how they went about getting there (who was she to judge?). Known for her movie premieres and other guest-list-driven social events, she bragged that she \u201cruined the Hamptons\u201d to Vanity Fair in a profile back in 1996.\n\nPublicity-party invites are an amoral game, driven by status and FOMO. Like everyone, she worked with Harvey Weinstein when he was an Oscar machine, the toast of the town. So you can\u2019t blame Siegal for including someone who already knew all the boldface power people. In 2008, in the teeth of the accusations against Epstein, he was spotted by a New York party reporter, \u201cunshaven, smiling that feline-monkey grin,\u201d at the Siegal-engineered screening of the HBO film Bernard and Doris at the Time Warner Center. But after prison, apparently Epstein needed her more than ever: In a Times story on how Manhattan\u2019s A-list refused to shun him, Siegal in particular was willing to help him (for free, apparently), \u201cusing her gate-keeping powers to usher Mr. Epstein, a friend, into screenings and events.\u201d In 2010, she threw a dinner party at his Upper East Side townhouse for Prince Andrew, Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, Charlie Rose, and Woody Allen. She and Epstein might have had other reasons to get along: Siegal, who has just turned 72, is a self-invention as well, without a particularly pedigreed background. Also notable is the fact that, as she told Vanity Fair in 2012, \u201cmy favorite way to travel\u201d to Cannes is \u201con a friend\u2019s G5 from Teterboro to Nice.\u201d \u2014Carl Swanson\n\nSlater, Rodney: Secretary of Transportation under Bill Clinton.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFlight logs record Slater taking a flight from Ghana to Nigeria in September 2002.\n\nSoros, Peter: Nephew of George Soros.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nConspiracy theorists looking through Epstein\u2019s black book will be disappointed that George Soros never appears \u2014 but they can find Peter.\n\nSpacey, Kevin: Actor.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book and on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nFlew with Bill Clinton to Africa (and, according to flight logs, the Azores) on Epstein\u2019s plane.\n\nSpector, Warren: Bear Stearns executive.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nStanbury, Caroline: Socialite.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWent on to star on Bravo\u2019s Ladies of London.\n\nStarr, Kenneth: Former United States solicitor general.\n\nObviously, lawyers do not share guilt for their clients\u2019 crimes. But it\u2019s striking that Kenneth Starr chose to join Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s defense team in 2007, after his moral fulminations against Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual perfidy. His obsessive pursuit of President Clinton made him a folk hero on the right, representing the defense of traditional sexual virtue and the notion that it was under assault by Bill Clinton and the liberal elite. His special-prosecutor exploits propelled him to the presidency of the conservative Baptist Baylor University. During his tenure, the football program engaged in a horrific pattern of sexual abuse that led to the dismissal of the football coach and the removal of Starr after an investigation found \u201cactions by University administrators that directly discouraged some complainants from reporting or participating in student conduct processes.\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps coincidental, but Starr has tracked the broader conversion of the religious right from sexual shaming to sexual shamelessness. In an era when Donald Trump has exposed the hollowness of so many values conservatives allegedly hold dear, it is fitting that this Zelig of right-wing sexual hypocrisy has made yet another cameo. \u2014Jonathan Chait\n\nStephanopoulos, George: Former White House communications director.\n\nAttended a dinner at Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse for Prince Andrew in 2010. \u201cThat dinner was the first and last time I\u2019ve seen him,\u201d Stephanopoulos said recently. \u201cIt was a mistake to go.\u201d\n\nSummers, Larry: Former Treasury secretary.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nWith Robert Trivers and Larry Summers at Harvard in 2004. Photo: Rick Friedman/Polaris\n\nBy the time the accusations of Epstein trafficking in girls surfaced, Larry Summers was out as Harvard\u2019s president, having alienated much of the faculty, including two black professors who jumped ship, and spitballing about women\u2019s biological inferiority in the sciences. But his tenure \u2014 2001 to \u201906, bookended by serving as Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama\u2019s director of the National Economic Council \u2014 overlapped with a high-water mark of Harvard\u2019s love affair with Epstein. Epstein, reads a story published in the Harvard Crimson in 2003, \u201chas found Harvard the perfect staging ground for his intellectual pursuits.\u201d Then-president Summers didn\u2019t comment, but Alan Dershowitz confided that Epstein \u201cspeaks well of Larry, and I think he admires Larry\u2019s economic thinking.\u201d Lucky Larry, to be recognized by such an eminence.\n\nEpstein, of course, was not an alumnus of Harvard (or anywhere), or a faculty member, but he was a donor. Asked by the Crimson in 2006 whether Epstein\u2019s $6.5 million donation should be returned, interim president Derek Bok referred to an earlier statement that Harvard has no \u201cobligation to investigate each donor and impose detailed moral standards.\u201d Summers imposed his own moral standards, hitching a ride on Epstein\u2019s plane. (A representative had no comment.) Even after Epstein registered as a sex offender, the Boston Globe reported, Summers\u2019s wife, Harvard English professor Elisa New, accepted Epstein\u2019s $110,000 donation to her PBS poetry show. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nTaymor, Julie: Director.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nResponsible for one of the biggest hits in Broadway history, The Lion King, and one of the biggest flops, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.\n\nTrivers, Robert: Evolutionary biologist.\n\nIn 2015, he defended Epstein, saying, \u201cBy the time they\u2019re 14 or 15, they\u2019re like grown women were 60 years ago, so I don\u2019t see these acts as so heinous.\u201d This month, he called his past statement \u201cstupid and offensive.\u201d\n\nTrump, Donald: President and partygoer.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nAt a party at Mar-a-Lago on November 1992. Photo: via NBC\n\nThere it was, yet another tape. This time, the now-president was filmed, in footage dredged up by NBC, in 1992 at Mar-a-Lago, hosting a party attended by a bevy of Buffalo Bills cheerleaders \u2014 and Epstein, from whom Trump has tried to distance himself since the arrest. He knew him only like anyone else in Palm Beach knew him, he said recently, although there were several entries for Trump in the black book, including a \u201cdirect emergency contact,\u201d and 17 years ago Trump had boasted to this magazine that he\u2019d known him forever and that he was a \u201cterrific guy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the denial in the face of evidence that, yes, he really did hang out with the guy that makes this set of film so classically Trumpian. The tape distills Trump to a certain essence: In this frame, he dances, snapping his fingers and spinning, surrounded by women \u2014 but profoundly alone, backing off and avoiding eye contact the second a woman moves in to dance with him. In another frame, he smiles with self-satisfaction as a crowd of women chants his name. Surrounded by a group of cheerleaders about to pose for a picture, he reaches around the waist of one and pulls her sharply in to him, then briskly cups her behind in a businesslike, joyless fashion while she reaches for her hair to maintain smiling composure. It\u2019s as if he thinks it\u2019s his vaguely grim duty, as an American man playing the campiest possible version of swinging billionaire bachelor, to grab the closest available body part.\n\nAnd most telling is his sideline locker-room talk with Epstein, whom the camera catches entering the party, greeted warmly by Trump. Like teenagers, they stand at the edges of the dance floor, pointing out the women they like, laughing at private jokes about them, rating them as hot. Here, there is joy. You see in this moment two outer-borough boys who have successfully crashed the Manhattan Establishment, who have boorishly, clumsily used money to get everything they want \u2014 but whose desires have never moved beyond an adolescent vision of the world, of women, of men, of the good life, of who merits consideration and who can be used.\n\nIn middle age, Trump had enough self-control to understand that his worst instincts were best received by men who were an awful lot like him. Now, as an old man \u2014 the oldest teenager ever \u2014 Trump has lost even that filter. He\u2019s turned the whole country into his bunga-bunga party, made a Mar-a-Lago of the world stage, and divided us into Epsteins and cheerleaders \u2014 either co-conspirators who love the license his immaturity grants or else disposable collateral damage. \u2014Noreen Malone\n\nRead More: NBC Obtained Trump-Epstein Footage After Trump Kissed an Anchor Without Consent\n\nTrump, Ivana: Donald Trump\u2019s first ex-wife.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nTrump, Ivanka: Daughter of Donald and Ivana Trump.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nTrump, Melania: Wife of Donald Trump.\n\nWith Trump, Melania, and Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.

Tuttle, a designer of luxury resorts by trade, renovated the main compound on Epstein\u2019s 70-acre private island in 2003. Sometime between 2009 and 2013, a \u201ctemple\u201d appeared on the island: a large, boxy, blue-and-white-striped structure with a golden dome, surrounded by palm trees. In the days after Epstein\u2019s arrest, the temple became the object of fervent speculation online. It was the kind of irresistible conspiracy-bait that exemplifies the Epstein story: On the one hand, shouldn\u2019t it be enough that a mysteriously wealthy banker with connections to the globe\u2019s most powerful people was apparently operating a child sex-trafficking ring without dabbling in theories about occult island temples? On the other hand, though, once you\u2019ve accepted that, why would occult island temples be so out of the question? On the edges, the Epstein saga could seem less like a news story than like a brutal, unreadable fairy tales. Or maybe it was a desire to take a story about financial power and social privilege colluding to protect a criminal predator and transform it into something more terrible and monumental.

Though there\u2019s no indication Vance and Epstein were friendly, his office has been criticized previously for declining to pursue sex-crimes charges against Harvey Weinstein that coincided with a donation from his attorneys (though Weinstein has since been charged by Vance\u2019s office) and fraud charges against Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. \u2014Irin Carmon\n\nWachner, Linda: Head of the textile corporation behind Calvin Klein and Speedo.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWallace, Mike: 60 Minutes journalist.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWalters, Barbara: Broadcast journalist and TV personality.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWeinstein, Bob: Former co-chairman of Miramax Films and the Weinstein Company.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nWexner, Leslie: The money behind the money.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nRetailing billionaire Leslie Wexner was Epstein\u2019s only known client, the man who transferred the rights to that famous townhouse to him for free in 2011, years after they were supposed to no longer be in contact. The relationship stretches back to the late 1980s, a time when Wexner\u2019s star was on the rise. A 1985 cover story for New York visited him in Columbus, Ohio, where his retail empire was built. Journalist Julie Baumgold described how he, not unlike Epstein, was a self-made man, addicted to self-improvement, how he didn\u2019t know how to pronounce La Grenouille correctly and wanted to have his picture taken at the Whitney, and noted that \u201cWexner is what used to be known as a \u2018confirmed bachelor.\u2019 \u201d (He later married and has four children.) Not long after that piece, he was introduced to Epstein, who had left Bear Stearns under a cloud and was broke. He and Wexner hit it off, and Epstein soon began managing Wexner\u2019s finances. Wexner\u2019s credibility lent plausibility to the notion that Epstein managed billions from his Caribbean-island redoubt. Associates of Wexner, who is now worth $6.6 billion, didn\u2019t understand the attraction. Soon after the men began working together, Epstein moved into Wexner\u2019s Upper East Side mansion. Wexner bought the seven-story townhouse in 1989 for $13.2 million but apparently lived there only for a few months. The title was transferred in 2011 to a Virgin Islands entity controlled by Epstein. It is now worth $56 million. \u2014Michelle Celarier and Carl Swanson\n\nRead More: Who Is Les Wexner, and How Is He Connected to Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nWiesel, Elie: Nobel Prize winner.\n\nName found in Epstein\u2019s black book.\n\nZagat, Nina and Jim: Publishers.\n\nName found on Epstein\u2019s private jet log.\n\nZuckerman, Mort: Media mogul and newspaper publisher.\n\nZuckerman went into business with Epstein \u2014 briefly \u2014 in 2004, spending $25 million to invest in Radar, but he pulled the plug after just three issues.

New York City\u2019s medical examiner has ruled his death a suicide.\n\nThe money manager was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls, bringing them to his home for massages during which he masturbated or had intercourse with them. He was indicted in 2007, but as Julie K. Brown reported at the Miami Herald, he ultimately got just 13 months in a county jail, because of a deal signed by US attorney Alexander Acosta, who would later become secretary of labor under President Trump.\n\nIn July, however, Epstein was arrested in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking, in connection with allegations that he recruited young girls for abuse at his homes in New York and Palm Beach. If convicted, he could have faced 45 years in prison.\n\nEpstein said that any encounters he had with his accusers were consensual, and that he believed they were 18 at the time. He pleaded not guilty to the trafficking charges.\n\nBut disturbing allegations have continued to come out since Epstein\u2019s death. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, for example, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands said that the money manager had run a sex trafficking operation from his private islands, bringing in girls as young as 11 to be abused. And recipients of donations by Epstein are facing scrutiny \u2014 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, received $850,000 from Epstein, including gifts made after his jail sentence, a January report revealed.\n\nEpstein\u2019s story is a master class in the power dynamics that have been exposed by the Me Too movement but have yet to truly change.\n\nWhen authorities began investigating Epstein, he assembled a team of private investigators to dig up dirt on the girls who accused him and the police and prosecutors working the case. Then he and his team of powerful lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr, were able to convince prosecutors to go easy on him despite disturbing allegations by a growing number of women and girls.\n\nEpstein was proud of his \u201ccollection\u201d of famous friends, which included Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and there\u2019s long been speculation that some of these friends may have participated in his abuses. But because he was able to minimize publicity around the details of his case for so long, he was also able to keep details about anyone else who may have been involved out of the public eye.\n\nThe fact that Epstein avoided serious punishment for years is a reminder that the American justice system has long been all too willing to ignore the words of girls and women, especially when they accuse a wealthy and influential man. Now that Epstein is dead, the women who say he harmed them will not get to face him in court. But the investigation into his crimes is ongoing, and a number of women are pursuing civil claims against his estate. As the results of those legal actions become public, the web of power and influence that protected Epstein and those close to him from scrutiny is finally beginning to unravel.\n\nEpstein was known for his wealth and his predilection for young girls. Everything else was something of a mystery.\n\nJeffrey Epstein, who died at 66 years old, was known as an influential financier until his 2007 indictment for sex crimes \u2014 though there was a good deal of mystery about how, exactly, he made his money.\n\nAfter working at the investment bank Bear Stearns in the early 1980s, he founded his own firm, J. Epstein and Co., in 1982, advertising his services for those with assets worth more than $1 billion \u2014 and was soon managing billions of dollars in client assets. By 1992, he owned the largest private residence in Manhattan. For tax purposes, he ran his business from the island of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands since at least 1996, and near that island, he owned the island of Little St. James.\n\nThat island was also home to Epstein\u2019s foundation, the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation \u2014 best known for donating $6.5 million to Harvard University for the establishment of a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics program. In a 2003 Harvard Crimson article on Epstein and his gift to the university, he is described by Harvard luminaries \u2014 including Alan Dershowitz, who would later help represent him when Epstein was accused of sex crimes in 2007 \u2014 as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cone of the most pleasant philanthropists.\u201d\n\nIn a 2002 New York magazine profile, Epstein was described by even those closest to him as \u201cmysterious,\u201d with many of the sources of his immense wealth remaining largely unknown and with one acquaintance even comparing him to the Wizard of Oz, implying that there might be less behind the curtain than appearances would otherwise suggest:\n\nEpstein is said to run $15 billion for wealthy clients, yet aside from Limited founder Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held secret. A former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of brilliant scientists yet possesses no bachelor\u2019s degree. For more than ten years, he\u2019s been linked to Manhattan-London society figure Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media titan Robert Maxwell, yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his various planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is said to be Manhattan\u2019s largest private house yet runs his business from a 100-acre private island in St. Thomas. ... Says another prominent Wall Streeter: \u201cHe is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird.\u201d\n\nMichael Stroll, who sued Epstein over a failed business deal in the 2000s, told New York magazine in 2007, \u201cEverybody who\u2019s his friend thinks he\u2019s so darn brilliant because he\u2019s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.\u201d\n\nEpstein was also an accumulator of famous friends \u2014 and his connections would later prove extremely important as he attempted to defend himself against allegations of sexual abuse. He gained some measure of fame in the early 2000s for flying President Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey, and comedian Chris Tucker to Africa to tour AIDS prevention and treatment project sites. Clinton would go on to fly multiple times on Epstein\u2019s private plane in 2002 and 2003, according to flight logs obtained by Gawker in 2015. Gawker also obtained and published Epstein\u2019s address book, which included politicians, actors, and celebrities.\n\nIn 2002, Epstein described his famous friends as a \u201ccollection\u201d of sorts, saying, \u201cI invest in people \u2014 be it politics or science. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d He was at one point spending $20 million per year to subsidize a group of scientists and their research on topics ranging from Tibetan monks to altruistic behavior. He was also good friends with Donald Trump, who described Epstein to New York magazine in 2002 as someone who \u201cenjoys his social life.\u201d\n\nThe money manager\u2019s friends and acquaintances were apparently willing to continue socializing with him despite his tendency to have eccentric or even downright disturbing ideas. Several people say that he wanted to \u201cuse his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies,\u201d James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg of the New York Times reported in July. The idea was not a secret, they write; one scientist recalls Epstein discussing it during a dinner at his townhouse in 2001, while another Times source remembers hearing about it from Epstein and at least one other person.\n\nThe fact that Epstein was able to retain his famous \u201ccollection\u201d of friends despite talking openly about using himself as the center of a eugenics experiment may be a testament to his influence, to his associates\u2019 ability to look the other way, or both.\n\nEpstein\u2019s connections are crucial to understanding his story. They may have helped him get a lighter sentence in 2008, but they\u2019re important for another reason too. His friendships with famous people have led to speculation that they, too \u2014 most notably Clinton and Trump \u2014 might have participated in his abuse of girls. But because Epstein was able to keep all the details of his prosecution quiet, it\u2019s impossible for the public to know exactly who else was involved in his crimes. By protecting himself, Epstein may have been able to protect his famous friends as well.\n\nA police investigation found that Epstein had sexually abused dozens of girls. He got a shockingly light sentence.\n\nMuch of Epstein\u2019s \u201csocial life\u201d involved very young women. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years,\u201d Trump said in 2002. \u201cTerrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d\n\nIn the 2007 New York magazine article, Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff described flying on Epstein\u2019s private plane in the 1990s, saying Epstein \u201cwas followed onto the plane by \u2014 how shall I say this? \u2014 by three teenage girls not his daughters\u201d who were \u201c18, 19, 20, who knows\u201d and \u201cmodel-like.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has never been secretive about the girls,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cAt one point, when his troubles began, he was talking to me and said, \u2018What can I say, I like young girls.\u2019 I said, \u2018Maybe you should say, \u2018I like young women.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFinally, in 2005, a woman reported to Florida police that a wealthy man had molested her stepdaughter, according to the Daily Beast. The tip led Palm Beach detectives to investigate, and they identified multiple girls who said Epstein had abused them. The case was eventually referred to the FBI, and in 2008, after years of investigation and legal wrangling, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution in a deal with federal prosecutors.\n\nAccording to court and police records reviewed by the Miami Herald\u2019s Julie Brown, Epstein routinely had underage girls brought to his Palm Beach mansion, where he paid them to give him massages. During the massages, he often subjected the girls to sexual abuse \u2014 asking them to touch him while he masturbated, touching them himself, and sometimes having intercourse with them, Brown reports. Then, according to the Herald, he would offer them money to find him more girls \u2014 which some of them did, finding recruits at malls and house parties.\n\nAccording to Joseph Recarey, the lead Palm Beach detective on the case, Epstein was essentially operating a \u201csexual pyramid scheme.\u201d Brown identified about 80 women who say they were molested or otherwise sexually abused by Epstein, and some accounts suggest the total number may be much higher.\n\n\u201cHe told me he wanted them as young as I could find them,\u2019\u2019 Courtney Wild, who says she recruited 70 or 80 girls for Epstein, told Brown. \u201cHe wanted as many girls as I could get him. It was never enough.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn response to lawsuits by some of the girls, Epstein has said that they consented to \u201cthe acts alleged\u201d and that he believed they were 18, the Daily Beast reports.\n\nIn many cases, the effects on the girls were devastating.\n\n\u201dThe women who went to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s mansion as girls tend to divide their lives into two parts,\u201d Brown writes: \u201clife before Jeffrey and life after Jeffrey.\u201d\n\nWild was a 14-year-old middle school student and cheerleading captain when she met Epstein, Brown writes. She later became addicted to drugs and served three years in prison on drug charges.\n\nOne woman who said Epstein molested her was found dead of a heroin overdose in 2017, leaving behind a young son.\n\nThe FBI had prepared a 53-page sex crimes indictment for Epstein in 2007 that could have sent him to prison for life, according to the Herald. Instead, he cut a deal with Alexander Acosta, then the US attorney in Miami, which allowed him to serve just 13 months \u2014 not in federal or state prison, but in a private wing of a Palm Beach county jail.\n\nHe was granted work release to go to a \u201ccomfortable office\u201d for 12 hours a day, six days a week, despite the fact that the Palm Beach Sheriff\u2019s Department prohibited work release for sex offenders.\n\nEpstein\u2019s deal, called a \u201cnon-prosecution agreement,\u201d granted immunity to \u201cany potential co-conspirators,\u201d meaning that if any of Epstein\u2019s powerful friends were involved in his crimes, they would face no consequences. And Acosta agreed that the deal would be kept secret from the victims, preventing them from showing up in court to try to challenge it.\n\nNew charges seemed like a new chance for prosecutors to hold Epstein accountable\n\nIn July 2019, though, Epstein was arrested at a New Jersey airport upon his return from a trip to France. He was charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy in federal court in New York. If convicted, he could have faced up to 45 years in prison, along with the forfeiture of his Manhattan townhouse, according to the New York Times.\n\nProsecutors weren\u2019t worried about double jeopardy in this case, a source told the Washington Post, probably because the New York case includes new victims or new alleged crimes. Significantly, the indictment alleged that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein recruited girls as young as 14 not just to his Palm Beach residence, but also to his Manhattan house, where he sexually abused them.\n\nThe indictment also states that Epstein knew some of the girls were underage, because they \u201cexpressly told him their age.\u201d And the document states that Epstein \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Epstein, the New York case seemed like it could potentially lead to charges against some of those \u201cassociates.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that prosecutors will not stop with Mr. Epstein because there were many other people who participated with him and made the sex trafficking possible,\u201d David Boies, a lawyer for some of Epstein\u2019s accusers, told the Daily Beast.\n\nIt also appeared possible that Epstein could give up information on crimes by some of his powerful friends in exchange for a lighter sentence, though former New York prosecutor Mimi Rocah wrote in the Daily Beast that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t expect the ridiculous sweetheart deal he got the first time around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are probably quite a few important people, powerful people, who are sweating it out right now,\u201d the Miami Herald\u2019s Brown said in a July MSNBC appearance. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see whether Epstein is going to name names.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in July, after repeated calls for his resignation, Acosta announced he was stepping down from his Labor Department post.\n\nThe new charges also led to a new public allegation. In July, 32-year-old Jennifer Araoz said in an interview with NBC\u2019s Today that a young woman approached her outside her New York City high school in 2001, engaged her in conversation, and ended up introducing her to Epstein at his New York townhouse. At first, she said, they just talked, with her telling him about her father\u2019s death from AIDS a few years before. But over the next year, Araoz said, Epstein manipulated her into giving him massages that ended with him masturbating. Then, in 2002, she said, \u201che raped me, forcefully raped me.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s case is an example of how wealthy and powerful men can get away with sexual abuse\n\nFor a time, Epstein was markedly forthcoming about some of the allegations against him. In one communication with Palm Beach police in 2005, his attorney said, \u201cMr. Epstein is very passionate about massages. \u2026 The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him; that is why he has had many massages.\u201d He even donated $100,000 to Ballet Florida purely so that dancers could also have massages.\n\nDespite the severity of the crimes he was accused of, Epstein avoided major consequences thanks to his wealth and connections.\n\nHe was able to hire a team, including private investigators, Dershowitz, and Starr, famous for his investigation of Bill Clinton. His investigators and lawyers worked to discredit or intimidate the women and girls who came forward, and the authorities working on the case, according to the Herald.\n\nAfter the case was referred to the FBI, Epstein\u2019s team mounted a \u201cyear-long assault\u201d on federal prosecutors, investigating them and their families looking for \u201cpersonal peccadilloes\u201d that might disqualify them from the case, according to a 2011 public statement by Acosta.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without Epstein\u2019s substantial fortune. But his relationships with other powerful people may also have played a key role. Epstein\u2019s plea agreement refers to unspecified information he supplied to federal investigators, according to Brown. It\u2019s not clear what that information was, but Brown notes that Epstein was a key federal witness in the prosecution of two executives with Bear Stearns, the investment brokerage that failed as part of the 2008 financial crisis. Epstein had at one time been an investor in a hedge fund managed by those executives. So it\u2019s possible that his knowledge about other wealthy men helped keep him out of prison. (The executives were eventually acquitted.)\n\nUltimately, Brown reports, Acosta caved under the pressure. He and his team not only allowed Epstein to avoid a long prison sentence but also worked with Epstein\u2019s lawyers to make sure the case was kept as quiet as possible.\n\nAll told, Brown\u2019s extensive reporting paints a picture that\u2019s all too common: a rich and well-connected man manipulating the legal system to protect himself. The account recalls the case of producer Harvey Weinstein, who, according to the New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow, hired an army of private investigators, including ex-Mossad agents, to track actresses and journalists in an effort to suppress sexual harassment and assault allegations against him.\n\nEpstein\u2019s deal with prosecutors did more than just protect him. By granting immunity to potential co-conspirators, it let any friends or associates of Epstein who might also have participated in his abuse avoid consequences as well.\n\nOver the years, speculation has swirled about which of Epstein\u2019s famous friends, if any, might have committed sex crimes on his properties. During the 2016 presidential race, then-Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus speculated that Bill Clinton might have been involved: \u201cWhen you hang out with a guy who has a reputation like Jeffrey Epstein, multiple times, on private jets, on weekends, on trips, on places at least where it\u2019s been reported not very good things happen, it would be good to know what our former president was doing,\u201d he told Bloomberg. (Clinton, however, has not been accused of any specific Epstein-related wrongdoing.)\n\nAlso during the 2016 race, a woman going by the name Katie Johnson sued Trump, saying he had raped her at one of Epstein\u2019s parties when she was 13, the Daily Beast reports. She later dropped the suit.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for the public to know how to evaluate these claims when so little about Epstein\u2019s crimes has ever come to light, due to pressure from his lawyers and acquiescence from prosecutors. Epstein\u2019s money and influence have protected not just Epstein but anyone who might be connected to him, a disturbing example of power perpetuating itself.\n\nThe girls and women who reported abuse by Epstein, meanwhile, were markedly powerless. Most of them \u201ccame from disadvantaged families, single-parent homes or foster care,\u201d Brown reports. \u201cMany of the girls were one step away from homelessness.\u201d\n\nTheir youth and poverty may have made it easier for Epstein and his alleged recruiters to lure them in with promises of cash, easier for investigators to intimidate them, and easier for prosecutors to discount or disbelieve them when the time came.\n\nInvestigation into Epstein continues after his death\n\nDespite Epstein\u2019s death, investigation and legal action in his case have continued, leading to further revelations about his influence, as well as his ability to avoid consequences for the allegations against him.\n\nFor example, according to lawsuits filed after his death, Epstein coerced two women to have sex with him while he was on work release, Ali Watkins reports at the New York Times. He had previously recruited them in New York, and had them flown to Florida to have sex with him during his jail sentence, the suits allege.\n\nAnother lawsuit, filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, alleges that Epstein brought girls as young as 11 or 12 to his private island for sexual abuse, using a database to track their movements, the Times reports. In one case, a 15-year-old girl tried to swim off the island and escape after being forced to perform sex acts, the suit alleges, but she was captured and Epstein confiscated her passport.\n\nMeanwhile, the new charges against Epstein, as well as his death, have led to increased attention to the way he used donations to academics and institutions as a way to launder his public image after his 2007 indictment. MIT, in particular, has been the focus of scrutiny, with the director of the university\u2019s Media Lab, Joichi Ito, resigning in September after a report showed that he received donations from Epstein and worked to conceal their source. In January, an investigation by the university found that Epstein had made 10 donations between 2002 and 2017, and that top administrators had been aware of the gifts, the New York Times reported. (Epstein had been a registered sex offender since 2008.)\n\nThough unique in many ways, Epstein\u2019s case is also common in others: one of all too many instances in which victims of sexual misconduct are ignored or brushed aside when they come from marginalized groups. Women who have come forward to say that singer R. Kelly abused them have faced a similar kind of erasure. As Vox\u2019s Constance Grady notes, Kelly has been \u201caccused of creating an abusive \u2018sex cult\u2019 of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally.\u201d\n\nGirls and young women are routinely seen as unreliable narrators of their own experiences, including abuse, and it typically takes the testimony of many women for a powerful man to face any consequences. For example, young female athletes had been reporting abuse by Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics team doctor who was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison earlier this year for abusing more than 100 young athletes, since 1997. For more than a decade, officials at Michigan State University, where he worked, did nothing.\n\nIt took a groundbreaking investigation by the Indianapolis Star, the brave testimony of dozens of survivors, and, perhaps, the growing strength of the #MeToo movement, to finally bring Nassar to justice.\n\nMeanwhile, for the women who say Epstein abused them, that justice has been elusive.\n\nIt seemed that might be about to change after Epstein\u2019s July arrest. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Michelle Licata, one of Epstein\u2019s accusers, told the Miami Herald upon hearing about the new indictment. \u201cFinally, finally, finally! Justice!\u201d\n\nBut Epstein\u2019s death ends his prosecution for the indictment filed in July. However, New York authorities are continuing to investigate Epstein\u2019s case, and a number of women are filing suit against his estate.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the victims I represent, we would have preferred [Jeffrey Epstein] lived to face justice,\u201d attorney Lisa Bloom said shortly after his death. But, she continued: \u201cOur civil cases can still proceed against his estate. Victims deserve to be made whole for the lifelong damage he caused. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the name of the island Epstein owns. The island\u2019s name is Little St. James.\n\nUpdate: Though Epstein had previously said he donated $30 million to Harvard University, a Harvard source familiar with the donation told Vox the money manager only gave $6.5 million.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s suicide is unexpectedly shining a light on the conditions in America\u2019s jails.\n\nSubscribe to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including: Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and ART19.", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18116351/jeffrey-epstein-case-indictment-arrested-trump-clinton"}, "article3": {"title": "Jeffrey Epstein Is Accused of Luring Girls to His Manhattan Mansion and Abusing Them", "content": "In fact, Mr. Epstein has long had links to a wide array of high-profile officials, celebrities and business moguls \u2014 from Mr. Trump to Bill Clinton to Prince Andrew.\n\nIn the era of #MeToo, Mr. Epstein\u2019s case had remained stubb ornly unresolv ed.
