Ted Cruz of Texas during the 2016 election was one of the dirtiest in recent memory.\n\nTrump and Cruz, who dropped out of the GOP primary in May 2016, attacked each other's wives, citizenship, and integrity. They even threatened to sue, accusing each other of lying and cheating for various reasons.\n\nAfter Trump won the party's nomination, Cruz refused to endorse him at the Republican National Convention.\n\nCruz finally came around to make that endorsement in September 2016, and the two have worked together on Republican legislation since Trump took office.\n\nBy October 22, 2018, Trump even decided that Cruz was no longer \"lyin' Ted\" \u2014 his notorious nickname for the senator during the campaign \u2014 and was now \"beautiful Ted.\" The president made the announcement ahead of a campaign rally he hosted in Texas to support Cruz's tough reelection bid.\n\nHere are 40 of the most memorable attacks the two threw at each other during the 2016 presidential campaign:", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-cruz-feud-history-worst-attacks-2016-9"}, "article2": {"title": "14 Times Donald Trump and Ted Cruz Insulted Each Other", "content": "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday, just a couple months after he reinforced their bitter rivalry by declining to back Trump in a speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\nLong before Cruz credited Trump with being \u201cthe only thing standing in [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] way,\u201d the two spent months slinging insults back and forth.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable.\n\nTrump: Cruz is \u201cworse than Hillary\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said with the being a Canadian citizen, he said, \u2018Oh I didn\u2019t know that.\u2019 How did he not know that? Then he said with the loans, \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know that,\u2019 Smart guy. He doesn\u2019t know that? Yeah, that\u2019s worse than Hillary when you think about it,\u201d Trump said of Cruz on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump: \u201cHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?\u201d Trump tweeted on Feb. 12.\n\nTrump: \u201cYou are the single biggest liar'\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the single biggest liar. You probably are worse than Jeb Bush,\u201d Trump told Cruz at a primary debate on Feb. 13. \u201cNasty guy. Now I know why he doesn\u2019t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI will spill the beans on your wife!\u201d\n\n\u201cLyin\u2019 Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin\u2019 Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!\u201d Trump tweeted on March 22.\n\nAs PolitiFact has noted, Trump had no evidence that Cruz was responsible for the ad that used a scantily clad picture of Melania Trump; the ad actually came from an anti-Trump super PAC.\n\nCruz: \u201cReal men don\u2019t attack women\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald, real men don\u2019t attack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life,\u201d Cruz tweeted on March 24, after Trump shared an unflattering comparison of Melania Trump and Heidi Cruz.\n\nCruz: \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife. It is not acceptable for him to make insults, to send nasty tweets\u2014and I don\u2019t know what he does late at night, but he tends to do these at about 11:30 at night, I assume when his fear is at the highest point,\u201d Cruz said on March 24. \u201cI don\u2019t get angry often. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time. Donald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\nCruz: \u201cConsistently disgraceful\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow,\u201d Cruz tweeted on March 25.\n\nCruz: \u201cNominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck\u201d\n\n\u201cNominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck. It would be handing the White House over to Hillary Clinton,\u201d Cruz tweeted on March 29.\n\nCruz: \u201cBig government liberal\u201d\n\n\u201cThis race is simple. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both big government liberals,\u201d Cruz tweeted on April 26.\n\nTrump: Cruz\u2019s father was somehow involved with JFK\u2019s assassin\n\n\u201cHis father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald\u2019s being\u2014you know, shot. I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Trump said about Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, in an interview on May 3. \u201cWhat was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nCruz: \u201cThis man is a pathological liar\u201d\n\n\u201cThis man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology text book, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying,\u201d Cruz told reporters on May 3. \u201cThe man cannot tell the truth, but he combines it with being a narcissist\u2014a narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him,\u201d Cruz added. \u201cDonald is a bully. \u2026 Bullies come from a deep, yawning cavern of insecurity.\u201d\n\nCruz: \u201cVote your conscience\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd to those listening, please, don\u2019t stay home in November,\u201d Cruz said on July 20 in his speech at the Republican National Convention, declining to endorse Trump. \u201cIf you love our country, and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nCruz: \u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz said on July 21, after declining to endorse Trump in his convention speech.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say when you stand up and say, \u2018Vote your conscience,\u2019 and rabid supporters of our nominee begin screaming, \u2018What a horrible thing to say,'\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t make the case for the American people that voting for our party\u2019s nominee is consistent with voting your conscience, is consistent with defending freedom and being faithful to the Constitution, then we are not going to win and we don\u2019t deserve to win.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe may have ruined his political career\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, he may have ruined his political career. I feel so badly. I feel so badly. And you know, he\u2019ll come and endorse over the next little while. He\u2019ll\u2014because he has no choice. But I don\u2019t want his endorsement. What difference does it make? I don\u2019t want his endorsement. I have such great\u2014I don\u2019t want his endorsement.

Asked if he thought Cruz would run sooner rather than later, McAuliffe said, \u201cThat depends on how good a job Trump does as president.\u201d\n\nBut hard feelings against Trump have remained deep among other Republicans.\n\nRegina Thompson, Cruz\u2019s Colorado state director and deputy director of an effort to unbind the delegates from Trump, said, \u201cPersonally, I will not support Trump.
