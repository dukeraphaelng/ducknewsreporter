They were dredged up this week by an anti-Trump super PAC, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, and covered by a number of media outlets, including CNN.\n\nThe panel in question was tackling the topic of gender equality in the military; CNN reports that Conway \u2014 then a Republican pollster, according to PBS\u2019 credits \u2014 brought up the subject of rape unprompted.\n\n\u201cIf we were physiologically \u2014 not mentally, emotionally, professionally \u2014 equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist,\u201d Conway said. \u201cYou would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the entirety of the conversation at PBS.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "url": "https://time.com/4473683/kellyanne-conway-trump-rape/"}, "article2": {"title": "Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway Said if Women Were Stronger, Rape Wouldn\u2019t Exist", "content": "Donald Trump has a woman problem. The Republican presidential nominee, who once said that letting his wife work was a \u201cvery dangerous thing,\u201d has consistently trailed Hillary Clinton by double-digit margins in favorability among women throughout the 2016 election. But while Trump\u2019s unpopularity with women voters is long established, the Trump campaign is facing a fresh wave of bad press emanating from an unlikely source: Kellyanne Conway, whose past comments about rape are suddenly back in the news.\n\nA recently surfaced video reveals Trump\u2019s newly-installed campaign manager committing a cardinal sin among women: victim blaming. Shortly after the Pentagon lifted the ban on women in combat roles, Conway participated in a roundtable discussion about the policy change, which aired on PBS\u2019s To the Contrary in January 2013, but was recently resurfaced by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump super-pac. After arguing that there shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cboy\u201d version and a \u201cgirl\u201d version of the fitness tests used to determine combat readiness, Conway went on to argue that rape wouldn\u2019t exist if women were stronger. \u201cIf we were physiologically\u2014not mentally, emotionally, professionally\u2014equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist,\u201d the G.O.P. pollster said. \u201cYou would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s less-than-nuanced commentary on rape culture is the latest in a slew of controversial remarks made by Trump and his campaign staff that have been seen as offensive to women. In July of last year, after the Daily Beast resurfaced a decades-old deposition in which Trump\u2019s ex-wife, Ivana, claimed that he had raped her, the Republican standard-bearer\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, insisted \u201cyou cannot rape your spouse.\u201d (Trump has denied the allegation, and Ivana has said she does not want her words \u201cto be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\u201d) Earlier this month, his daughter, Ivanka Trump, found herself at the center of another controversy after her father made some tone-deaf comments about sexual harassment in the workplace. Now, the Trump campaign is running damage control after 20-year-old domestic-abuse charges against newly minted campaign C.E.O. Stephen Bannon came to light mere weeks after he took the helm.\n\nThe rape commentary from Conway, who has been previously untouched by controversy during her time with the campaign, could be a particular blow to Trump\u2019s presidential bid. Conway, who notably quit Todd Akin\u2019s campaign after the U.S. Senate candidate\u2019s infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comment, was widely seen as a potential remedy to Trump\u2019s enduring deficit with women voters. When Trump elevated Conway to campaign manager, fellow G.O.P. pollster Frank Luntz, told The Wall Street Journal that \u201cshe understands women better than anyone in America,\u201d and added that she would be a \u201cgift in a campaign that's really been struggling with message.\u201d In light of Conway\u2019s message to women during the PBS roundtable, the pollster is unlikely to be the panacea to Trump\u2019s woman problem the campaign hoped for.", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/kellyanne-conway-controversial-rape-remark"}, "article3": {"title": "Trump associate\u2019s comment about rape from 2013 public TV show enters campaign fray", "content": "A comment made on the public television talk show To the Contrary in 2013 has become part of this week\u2019s news cycle in the presidential campaign.\n\nDuring a discussion of women in the military, pollster Kellyanne Conway, now campaign manager for Republican nominee Donald Trump, said in part that if women \u201cwere physiologically \u2014 not mentally, emotionally, professionally equal to men \u2014 if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist. You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off.\u201d (Skip to 4:18 in the video for her comment.)\n\nThe comment was pointed out Monday by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, part of the Keep America Great PAC. In a press release, the coalition said Conway\u2019s comment \u201chighlighted a disturbing pattern of behavior \u2014 a war on women coming directly\u201d from Conway. More than a dozen media outlets have reported on the comment, including CNN, Time, Vanity Fair and Britain\u2019s Independent.\n\nBonnie Erb\u00e9, host of the public affairs program, told Current that she \u201cvaguely recalls\u201d Conway\u2019s original statement. \u201cWe of course recognize it as a minority view,\u201d she said, \u201cbut others on the panel in that episode represented the majority view.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to provide a platform for the voices of women of all ethnicities, political persuasions and now gender identities,\u201d Erb\u00e9 added.\n\nErb\u00e9 said that Conway has appeared on the show as a regular panelist since the mid-1990s, \u201cwhen she was somewhat unknown.\u201d To the Contrary has also reported on Conway\u2019s polling business, The Polling Company/WomanTrend, which focuses on women\u2019s viewpoints.\n\nAfter media picked up the story Tuesday, visits to To the Contrary\u2019s website doubled over the previous 24 hours, Erb\u00e9 said.", "url": "https://current.org/2016/08/trump-associates-comment-about-rape-from-2013-public-tv-show-enters-campaign-fray/"}}
