And as her grip loosened on the country, the joy drained out of their eyes.\n\nThere was a resurgence as Virginia began to move towards Clinton, but that soon cooled as Clinton's chances slipped away once more. And there was no sign of the senior staff who had been expected to fill the floor.\n\nIn fact, until last week, the Clinton campaign was planning a fireworks victory display over the Hudson as early as 9.30pm. That plan would have been a damp squib had they pressed on with it amid falling approval polls in the wake of her FBI case being brought back into the public eye.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, was hunkered down in her hotel suite away from the party watching the dismal results.\n\nWeeping: Clinton supporters of all ages and types were left clutching their faces as their bad news rolled in\n\nDistraught: Several supporters appeared distraught as Clinton's plans for Presidential success unraveled\n\nHorror: Looks of horror swept over the crowd as Clinton slipped away from success\n\nSad day: It was a crushing climax to Clinton's two-year campaign for President\n\nFeeling blue: Hillary Clinton supporters in New York grew visibly gloomy as the US map slowly turned red and Trump's ascension to President became inevitable\n\nLosing hope: New York rally crowds watched in despair as Clinton lost her grip on the US\n\nTearful: Clinton supporters looked drained and on the verge of tears as their candidate faltered in the national election\n\nPopularity slump: A Clinton supporter cradles her head as the reality of the Democratic candidate's fate sinks in\n\nIn tears: Even Clinton supporters in the University of Sydney, Australia, were struck hard by her struggle\n\nRed-blooded: The mood among Trump supporters in Florida couldn't be more different\n\nPro-Trump fist-pump: Supporters of the Republican candidate in New York were thrilled, screaming for joy as he took state after state\n\nHats off: Trump supporters wave their hats in elation as the returns come in on Tuesday night\n\nRed, steady, go: Trump supporters at an election night rally in New York cheer and whoop as their candidate continues to climb the ladder to success\n\nLove and hat: A sea of red caps in the New York Hilton Midtown hotel is buoyed up by shouts and cheers\n\nSelfie smiles: More New York Trump supporters band together for a celebratory selfie at the Trump election night event\n\nSelfie sensation: A group of young Trump supporters take simultaneous selfies at the Midtown New York party\n\nExcitement: Trump's supporters were loud and proud during the historic night\n\nNorth and South: Both those in New York (left) and Florida (right) were thrilled by Trump's success on Election Night\n\nIn a traditional Clinton approach to press relations, reporters covering her party were frozen out of speaking to senior aides as she tanked in the election, and instead were reduced to texting and emailing to ask for updates.\n\nThe attitude at the Midtown Hilton, on 1335 Avenue of the Americas and a block over from Trump Tower, couldn't have been more different.\n\nAt the hotel, what looked increasingly likely to be Donald Trump's victory party remained jubilant and upbeat as state after state stayed on the board for the brash billionaire.\n\nTrump's director of African-American Outreach said at the party that both candidates have written concession speeches, according to the Hollywood Reporter - but it became clear that his candidate would have no use for it.\n\nPrivate: Trump held an invitation-only party at the New York Hilton (left) at 1335 Avenue of the Americas for 'friends and supporters of the Trump-Pence campaign'\n\nGlass act: The Hilton ballroom's stage was flanked with glass cases containing Trump hats and pins (pictured) for Trump's private event Tuesday night\n\nMemorabilia: Campaign merchandise, including pins and 'Make America Great Again' hats, were displayed at the Hilton hotel for Trump's invitation-only bash\n\nThe Hilton ballroom's stage was flanked with glass cases containing Trump hats and pins, and there were Trump TV stickers inside the Grand Ballroom, according to Washington Post video journalist Jorge Ribas.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine jubilant Trump reporters jumping on the items before they departed - if they didn't have them all before - as trophies of their jubilant night.\n\nSome wondered why the party wasn't being held at his own Trump Tower, just five minutes' walk away, but the Hilton's size appeared to be key.\n\n'The Hilton is huge,' crisis management firm president Helios Fred Garcia told the Washington Post.\n\n'I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that he\u2019s embarrassed to hold it in his own place or that his brand has been tarnished, but rather that he expects a large crowd. And so he booked the largest venue that he could.'\n\nThat proved to be a smart investment, as crowds, under the glare of a Trump-shaped victory cake, chugged their $11 beers - the cash-only bars charged from $7 to $13 - and cheered.\n\nDeflated, elated: A Clinton supporter in the New York can barely keep her head up (left) while a Trump supporter in the same city looks like she's ready to fly (right)\n\nHappy disbelief: Some Trump supporters appeared to show disbelief as he increased his hold on the American voter base\n\nCheers, no fears: Those looks of disbelief quickly turned to cheers of delight as state after state flipped to Trump\n\nWhite with shock: Clinton supporters hold their breath as results roll in about their candidate's collapse in the race\n\nGoing down: Clinton supporters in New York's Javits Center steeled themselves as their candidate continued to fall\n\nHold your head: A candidate clasps his face as states successively rejected Clinton\n\nWith Florida, North Carolina and Virginia turning out to be close races, the crowd cheered every time Fox News showed The Donald still ahead.\n\nCries of 'Drain the Swamp' dominated the chants, as many in the crowd donned red 'Make America Great Again' hats.\n\nOmarosa, one of Trump's most potent surrogates throughout the campaign, worked the crowd happily posing for selfies.\n\nEven when the state of New Mexico was called for Clinton, results showing The Donald ten points ahead received cheers from Trump's invited supporters.\n\nParty down: Clinton's campaign planned an open 'Hillary for America Election Night Event' at the Jacob K Javits Convention Center on 34th Street (left), but the excitement drained from the hall as the night wore on\n\nDamp squib: Until last week, Clinton's team were planning a firework party on the Hudson River in New York. Their decision to pull that proved prescient as their NY fans cringed\n\nNight terrors: As the night wore on, and the possibility of a Trump win became more real, the fear of Clinton fans became more pronounced\n\nFrozen out: While supporters like this one grimaced at the election results, reporters were frozen out from speaking to senior Clinton aides - not an unusual occurrence with the Clinton camp\n\nWhen Virginia was called for Clinton, some air rushed out of the room.\n\nWith Montana added to the Trump column, however, cheerful chatter started again.\n\nColorado was called for Clinton, but that didn't matter to Trump's faithful, because the announcement of Trump's win in Ohio came right after.\n\nThere were screams and one very loud whistle.\n\nSince 1904, Ohio has only been wrong about the winner of the presidency two times.\n\nDowncast ballot: The cross-section of Clinton's supporters were unified in misery as the routes to her victory closed off, one by one\n\nLiving on a prayer: The party mood that began with Jon Bon Jovi Monday night collapsed by Sunday evening\n\nDown, under: Clinton supporters in Sydney, Australia, fidgeted as their hopes and dreams evaporated\n\nBroke-lyn: Spirits of adults and children alike were crushed in Brooklyn as Clinton's supporters watched the key state of Florida glide into Trump's hands", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3918838/Dejected-Clinton-supporters-party-goes-flat-result-result-turns-against-cries-lock-louder-Trump-party.html"}}
