First, the idea for a punchy, uplifting dance video that would tell a story about diversity, difference and communal support. Then, 170 dancers, a few hours of rehearsals\u2013and pantsuits. Lots of pantsuits. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The result: the #Pantsuitpower Flashmob for Hillary dance video, performed at New York\u2019s Union Square. It\u2019s gotten nearly 2 million views on Facebook in a matter of days.\n\nThe video, accompanied by Justin Timberlake\u2019s contagiously boppy disco-pop song \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling,\u201d was posted on Facebook and Vimeo this week by Humanity for Hillary, a social media campaign aimed at artists, in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI wanted to bring some kind of humanity to her campaign, because I think humanity and love and humor tend to get lost when we\u2019re in the heat of all of this,\u201d says Celia Rowlson-Hall, 32, a New York-based choreographer who\u2019s worked on HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d and other TV shows and music videos. She and her Washington, D.C.-based friend, hiphop choreographer Crishon Landers, created the pantsuit dance, and Rowlson-Hall directed the video with her partner, Mia Lidofsky, an independent film producer. The couple met on the set of \u201cGirls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe just felt the need to do something,\u201d Rowlson-Hall says. \u201cWe thought, how can we creatively impact this election? So we made the video.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like dance to convey enthusiasm and energy, so it\u2019s a natural political tool. The fact that it\u2019s rarely used to rally voters\u2013and even more rarely used so well\u2013is what makes this video feel so fresh. That, and the clarity of the choreography, the invigorating spirit and skill of the video\u2019s massive chorus line, and the catchy tune.\n\nA graduate of North Carolina School of the Arts, Rowlson-Hall has worked in the New York dance scene for the past decade, first performing with a couple of troupes, and more recently choreographing for stage, film and television. She made her feature-film directorial debut with \u201cMa,\u201d writing the wordless script, choreographing it and starring in it; it became a favorite of the 2015 American Film Institute Festival. She and Landers choreographed the flashmob scene in about four hours, she says, using simple, clear moves drawn from hiphop, ballet and modern dance. Each bears a message: Raised fists signify #BlackLivesMatter, arms and faces tilted to the sky hint at solar energy, circling hips symbolize reproductive rights. In the quietest and most emotional moment, dancers take a knee to evoke San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest against police brutality. Others stand with a hand on their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is our right as a democracy to protest or honor the flag as we see fit,\u201d says Rowlson-Hall.\n\nShe put the word out on Instagram and Facebook seeking dancers. She videotaped herself dancing the steps, and texted it to the dancers who\u2019d replied. Many are professionals. A few came from Broadway\u2019s \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some came from as far away as Toronto. Assorted \u201cdance enthusiasts\u201d joined in\u2013dentists, other artists and little girls fresh from soccer practice. They had a couple days to learn the moves on their own, then they met in small groups for one-hour sessions with the choreographers. That\u2019s when they were also fitted for their pantsuits, an homage to Clinton\u2019s go-to workwear. A few suits were donated by Topshop. Stylists scoured thrift stores for the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNear the end you can glimpse the slender, short-haired Rowlson-Hall grooving in a pinstriped suit, her T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cThe Future is Female.\u201d\n\nFor all the ebullient energy of the dancing, the video also produced some headaches. The directors didn\u2019t have a permit to use Union Square for their shoot.\n\nDesigner Nina McLemore knows how to dress with attitude, which is why presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren go to her for clothes. (Video: Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe were terrified we\u2019d get shut down by the cops,\u201d says Lidofsky. They also feared pushback from Timberlake. They reached out to his manager about using his song, Lidofsky adds, but with no reply they plowed ahead, hoping Timberlake wouldn\u2019t mind. (No word from him yet.)\n\nThe only time the whole group rehearsed together was 20 minutes before the taping last Sunday morning, Oct 2.\n\n\u201cThe dancers came knowing the choreography to a T. I\u2019ve never seen dancers work like that,\u201d says Rowlson-Hall. \u201cIt was a whirlwind.\u201d\n\nClinton has some appreciation for dance: Her daughter, Chelsea, was a Washington School of Ballet student during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. So far, however, Hillary Clinton has been silent about the pantsuit dance.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re refreshing our email every single minute,\u201d Lidofsky says with a laugh. \u201cWe really hope she saw this, and felt the love.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end Share Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn MailSolid Email this link View Photos View Photos Next Image MANHATTAN, NY - The morning after loosing to Republican Nominee Donald Trump in the general Presidential election, Democratic Nominee for President of the United States former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, accompanied by former President Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine and Anne Holton, speaks to supporters and campaign staff in a packed ballroom at The New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York on Wednesday November 9, 2016.

The flash mob's five-minute, high-energy dance set to Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" played out before a large crowd of unsuspecting pedestrians.\n\nThe crowd consisted of professional dancers and other enthusiasts of all ages, races, and genders\u2014all brought together thanks to life partners Celia Rowlson-Hall and Mia Lidofsky. The couple dreamt up the idea of the flash mob last month, and produced the event in just under a week. The dance was meant to serve as a rallying cry for the presidential candidate, who they feel has not received the same level of fervent support as Donald Trump\u2014or, say, Bernie Sanders.\n\nLara Crozier\n\n\"We just haven't seen the same kind of rallies around her,\" Rowlson-Hall said after the performance. \"And as filmmakers and artists, [Mia and I] felt that we needed to help Hillary out the way that we know how,\" she continued. \"We've been upset to see all the hatred against her, and the focus on her pneumonia, and [the portrayal of] her as a weaker individual when she's so strong, so smart, so eloquent,\" said Lidofsky. \"They shouldn't be sharing the same stage,\" she added, referring to Donald Trump.\n\nMore From ELLE play icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\nLidofsky, who just wrapped up filming a TV show for Refinery 29 called Strangers, and Rowlson-Hall, a choreographer who has worked on the show Girls, admit to never having produced a public stunt of this magnitude\u2014let alone in such a short period of time. \"I have choreographed a flash mob for a TV show on ABC, and a few others, but I have personally never organized one,\" Rowlson-Hall shared. \"This is the biggest thing I've probably ever been a part of,\" said Lidofsky.\n\nBut for Lidofsky and Rowlson-Hall, Trump's combative debate performance was the last straw. \"It's the bigotry and vitriol, [of Donald Trump's campaign that we are responding to],\" said Lidofsky. \"So we were like, let's come together with what we know, which is love, unity, and community,\" she added.\n\nJacqueline Colette Prosper\n\n\"She had that shimmy,\" Lidofsky said, referring to the candidate's now famous shoulder move during the presidential debate. \"She gave us the shimmy,\" Rowlson-Hall agrees. \"And we gave her a dance.\"\n\nMia Lidofsky and Celia Rowlson-Hall Lara Crozier\n\nHow They Did it\n\nIt started with postings on Facebook and Instagram that invited \"all dancers, movers and shakers to perform in a pantsuit power dance video,\" at a secret location, celebrating \"badass boss Hillary Clinton...with love unity, and freedom of expression.\"\n\nThousands responded, but Lidofsky and Rowlson-Hall settled on 186 participants. Confirmed participants received links to an instructional YouTube video, detailing each dance step. And the organizers provided over 15 hours of rehearsal time at Peridance Capezio Center over the weekend for volunteers to practice the intricate moves.\n\nThe pair also enlisted the help of camera operators, stylists, and producers who volunteered in an effort to make the lively spectacle a reality. \"Every dancer, stylist, and camera person dedicated their time out of love and wanting to see Hillary win the election,\" said Lidofsky.\n\nParticipants included young children and pregnant women, all wearing candy-colored blazers. Nineteen-year-old Victoria traveled with her mother and sister from Hamilton, New Jersey after seeing the Facebook post. \"Celia and the whole group have just been awesome,\" her mother Gaynell said.\n\nLara Crozier\n\nThe crowd also included Dr. Rachel Frank. (Frank is my son's pediatrician, but the encounter was entirely coincidental.) Frank signed up herself and her two daughters to participate in the flash mob after spotting a hard copy version of the social media notice at 890 Broadway Dance Studio. She also wrangled two other friends, who also brought their children along with them. \"[This was] much better than sitting around and fretting without any sort of direct action,\" said her friend, Dr. Julia Hermos. \"It was one of the most joyous things I've done in a long time,\" Frank later told me.\n\nThe Dance\n\nEach move that Rowlson-Hall choreographed had a message behind it. After the performance, she explained the symbolism: circles made with her thumbs and index fingers, placed at her sides, resemble ovaries; parallel arms represent an equal sign; a raised fist telegraphs the Black Lives Matter Movement. \"And then,\" Rowlston-Hall said, as she demonstrated the dance steps. \"It's flash that suit, flash that suit,\"she said, opening her blue pin-stripped blazer. The dance also paid tribute to Colin Kaepernick, Gabby Douglas, and the LGBTQ community.\n\nDoug Kuntz\n\nRowlson-Hall selected Union Square as ground zero for its centrality and prominence. \"A lot of protests happen here,\" Rowlson-Hall points out; \"It's an active and identifiable location.\"\n\nDespite the impressive response and the hard work leading up to the event, last minute worries persisted. The pair did not have enough time to secure a permit, and so they were worried about getting shut down by the police. It was a challenge to find enough pantsuits for the stunt. \"We tapped out all of the thrift stores and Goodwills in NYC,\" says Lidofsky. Stores like Aritzia and Topshop donated items. Volunteers purchased even more. And for Rowlson-Hall, the biggest fear was that the volunteers would not show up: \"I didn't get much sleep,\" she confessed.\n\nDoug Kuntz\n\nKiki Valentine, who assisted Rowlson-Hall and Lidofsky with publicity, hopes this event will reach people across the country: \"Seeing this come to life and brighten a grey October morning\u2014to me it's a metaphor for the grey cloud Trump has placed over our country.\" She went on to say, \"Hillary is definitely progressive, qualified, smart, and ready to lead us as our first female President.\"\n\nJacqueline Colette Prosper is a writer, Brooklynite, pop culture obsessive, and a mom.
