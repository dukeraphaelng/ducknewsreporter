But when the top proponent was challenged in a Kansas courtroom to prove that such fraud is rampant, the claims went up in smoke.\n\nIn the end, the decision seemed inevitable. After a seven-day trial in Kansas City federal court in March, in which Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach needed to be tutored on basic trial procedure by the judge and was found in contempt for his \u201cwillful failure\u201d to obey a ruling, even he knew his chances were slim. Kobach told The Kansas City Star at the time that he expected the judge would rule against him (though he expressed optimism in his chances on appeal).\n\nSure enough, yesterday federal Judge Julie Robinson overturned the law that Kobach was defending as lead counsel for the state, dealing him an unalloyed defeat. The statute, championed by Kobach and signed into law in 2013, required Kansans to present proof of citizenship in order to register to vote. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, contending that the law violated the National Voter Registration Act (AKA the \u201cmotor voter\u201d law), which was designed to make it easy to register.\n\nThe trial had a significance that extends far beyond the Jayhawk state. One of the fundamental questions in the debate over alleged voter fraud \u2014 whether a substantial number of non-citizens are in fact registering to vote \u2014 was one of two issues to be determined in the Kansas proceedings. (The second was whether there was a less burdensome solution than what Kansas had adopted.) That made the trial a telling opportunity to remove the voter fraud claims from the charged, and largely proof-free, realms of political campaigns and cable news shoutfests and examine them under the exacting strictures of the rules of evidence.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what occurred and according to Robinson, an appointee of George W. Bush, the proof that voter fraud is widespread was utterly lacking. As the judge put it, \u201cthe court finds no credible evidence that a substantial number of noncitizens registered to vote\u201d even under the previous law, which Kobach had claimed was weak.\n\nFor Kobach, the trial should\u2019ve been a moment of glory. He\u2019s been arguing for a decade that voter fraud is a national calamity. Much of his career has been built on this issue, along with his fervent opposition to illegal immigration. (His claim is that unlawful immigrants are precisely the ones voting illegally.) Kobach, who also co-chaired the Trump administration\u2019s short-lived commission on voter fraud, is perhaps the individual most identified with the cause of sniffing out and eradicating phony voter registration. He\u2019s got a gilded resume, with degrees from Harvard University, Yale Law School and the University of Oxford, and is seen as both the intellect behind the cause and its prime advocate. Kobach has written voter laws in other jurisdictions and defended them in court. If anybody ever had time to marshal facts and arguments before a trial, it was Kobach.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t go well for him in the Kansas City courtroom, as Robinson\u2019s opinion made clear. Kobach\u2019s strongest evidence of non-citizen registration was anemic at best: Over a 20-year period, fewer than 40 non-citizens had attempted to register in one Kansas county that had 130,000 voters. Most of those 40 improper registrations were the result of mistakes or confusion rather than intentional attempts to mislead, and only five of the 40 managed to cast a vote.\n\nOne of Kobach\u2019s own experts even rebutted arguments made by both Kobach and President Donald Trump. The expert testified that a handful of improper registrations could not be extrapolated to conclude that 2.8 million fraudulent votes \u2014 roughly, the gap between Hillary Clinton and Trump in the popular vote tally \u2014 had been cast in the 2016 presidential election. Testimony from a second key expert for Kobach also fizzled.\n\nAs the judge\u2019s opinion noted, Kobach insisted the meager instances of cheating revealed at trial are just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d As she explained, \u201cThis trial was his opportunity to produce credible evidence of that iceberg, but he failed to do so.\u201d Dismissing the testimony by Kobach\u2019s witnesses as unpersuasive, Robinson drew what she called \u201cthe more obvious conclusion that there is no iceberg; only an icicle largely created by confusion and administrative error.\u201d\n\nBy the time the trial was over, Kobach, a charismatic 52-year-old whose broad shoulders and imposing height make him resemble an aging quarterback, seemed to have shrunk inside his chair at the defense table.\n\nBut despite his defeat, Kobach\u2019s causes \u2014 restricting immigration and tightening voting requirements \u2014 seem to be enjoying favorable tides elsewhere. Recent press accounts noted Kobach\u2019s role in restoring a question about citizenship, abandoned since 1950, to U.S. Census forms for 2020. And the Supreme Court ruled on June 11 that the state of Ohio can purge voters from its rolls when they fail to vote even a single time and don\u2019t return a mailing verifying their address, a provision that means more voters will need to re-register and prove their eligibility again.\n\nFor his own part, Kobach is now a candidate for governor of Kansas, running neck and neck with the incumbent in polls for the Republican primary on Aug. 7. It\u2019s not clear whether the verdict will affect his chances \u2014 or whether it will lead him and others to quietly retreat from claims of voter fraud. But the judge\u2019s opinion and expert interviews reveal that Kobach effectively put the concept of mass voter fraud to the test \u2014 and the evidence crumbled.\n\nAn election worker checks voter identification in Centropolis Township, Kansas, on Nov. 4, 2014. (Julie Denesha/Getty Images)\n\nPerhaps it was an omen. Before Kobach could enter the courtroom inside the Robert J. Dole U.S. Courthouse each day, he had to pass through a hallway whose walls featured a celebratory display entitled \u201cAmericans by Choice: The Story of Immigration and Citizenship in Kansas.\u201d Photographs of people who\u2019d been sworn in as citizens in that very courthouse were superimposed on the translucent window shades.\n\nPublic interest in the trial was high. The seating area quickly filled to capacity on the first day of trial on the frigid morning of March 6. The jury box was opened to spectators; it wouldn\u2019t be needed, as this was a bench trial. Those who couldn\u2019t squeeze in were sent to a lower floor, where a live feed had been prepared in a spillover room.\n\nFrom the moment the trial opened, Kobach and his co-counsels in the Kansas secretary of state\u2019s office, Sue Becker and Garrett Roe, stumbled over the most basic trial procedures. Their mistakes antagonized the judge. \u201cEvidence 101,\u201d Robinson snapped, only minutes into the day, after Kobach\u2019s team attempted to improperly introduce evidence. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\n\nMatters didn\u2019t improve for Kobach from there.\n\nThroughout the trial, his team\u2019s repeated mishaps and botched cross examinations cost hours of the court\u2019s time. Robinson was repeatedly forced to step into the role of law professor, guiding Kobach, Becker and Roe through courtroom procedure. \u201cDo you know how to do the next step, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d the judge asked Becker at one point, as she helped her through the steps of impeaching a witness. \u201cWe\u2019re going to follow the rules of evidence here.\u201d\n\nBecker often seemed nervous. She took her bright red glasses off and on. At times she burst into nervous chuckles after a misstep. She laughed at witnesses, skirmished with the judge and even taunted the lawyers for the ACLU. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to ask my questions on Monday!\u201d she shouted at the end of the first week, jabbing a finger in the direction of Dale Ho, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. Ho rolled his eyes.\n\nRoe was gentler \u2014 deferential, even. He often admitted he didn\u2019t know what step came next, asking the judge for help. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this one is objectionable. I hope it\u2019s not,\u201d he offered at one point, as he prepared to ask a question following a torrent of sustained objections. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know,\u201d an attorney for the plaintiffs responded, to a wave of giggles in the courtroom. On the final day of trial, as Becker engaged in yet another dispute with the judge, Roe slapped a binder to his forehead and audibly whispered, \u201cStop talking. Stop talking.\u201d\n\nKobach\u2019s cross examinations were smoother and better organized, but he regularly attempted to introduce exhibits \u2014 for example, updated state statistics that he had failed to provide the ACLU in advance to vet \u2014 that Robinson ruled were inadmissible. As the trial wore on, she became increasingly irritated. She implored Kobach to \u201cplease read\u201d the rules on which she based her rulings, saying his team had repeated these errors \u201cad nauseum.\u201d\n\nKobach seemed unruffled. Instead of heeding her advice, he\u2019d proffer the evidence for the record, a practice that allows the evidence to be preserved for appeal even if the trial judge refuses to admit it. Over the course of the trial, Kobach and his team would do this nearly a dozen times.\n\nEventually, Robinson got fed up. She asked Kobach to justify his use of proffers. Kobach, seemingly alarmed, grabbed a copy of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2014 to which he had attached a growing number of Post-it notes \u2014 and quickly flipped through it, trying to find the relevant rule.\n\nThe judge tried to help. \u201cIt\u2019s Rule 26, of course, that\u2019s been the basis for my rulings,\u201d she told Kobach. \u201cI think it would be helpful if you would just articulate under what provision of Rule 26 you think this is permissible.\u201d Kobach seemed to play for time, asking clarifying questions rather than articulating a rationale. Finally, the judge offered mercy: a 15-minute break. Kobach\u2019s team rushed from the courtroom.\n\nThe Daily Digest Get the latest news from ProPublica every afternoon.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to save him. In her opinion, Robinson described \u201ca pattern and practice by Defendant [Kobach] of flaunting disclosure and discovery rules.\u201d As she put it, \u201cit is not clear to the Court whether Defendant repeatedly failed to meet his disclosure obligations intentionally or due to his unfamiliarity with the federal rules.\u201d She ordered Kobach to attend the equivalent of after-school tutoring: six hours of extra legal education on the rules of civil procedure or the rules of evidence (and to present the court with a certificate of completion).\n\nIt\u2019s always a bad idea for a lawyer to try the patience of a judge \u2014 and that\u2019s doubly true during a bench trial, when the judge will decide not only the law, but also the facts. Kobach repeatedly annoyed Robinson with his procedural mistakes. But that was nothing next to what the judge viewed as Kobach\u2019s intentional bad faith.\n\nThis view emerged in writing right after the trial \u2014 that\u2019s when Robinson issued her ruling finding Kobach in contempt \u2014 but before the verdict. And the conduct that inspired the contempt finding had persisted over several years. Robinson concluded that Kobach had intentionally failed to follow a ruling she issued in 2016 that ordered him to restore the privileges of 17,000 suspended Kansas voters.\n\nIn her contempt ruling, the judge cited Kobach\u2019s \u201chistory of noncompliance\u201d with the order and characterized his explanations for not abiding by it as \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d She wrote that she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by Kobach\u2019s \u201cfailure to take responsibility for violating this Court\u2019s orders, and for failing to ensure compliance over an issue that he explicitly represented to the Court had been accomplished.\u201d Robinson ordered Kobach to pay the ACLU\u2019s legal fees for the contempt proceeding.\n\nThat contempt ruling was actually the second time Kobach was singled out for punishment in the case. Before the trial, a federal magistrate judge deputized to oversee the discovery portion of the suit fined him $1,000 for making \u201cpatently misleading representations\u201d about a voting fraud document Kobach had prepared for Trump. Kobach paid the fine with a state credit card.\n\nMore than any procedural bumbling, the collapse of Kobach\u2019s case traced back to the disintegration of a single witness.\n\nThe witness was Jesse Richman, a political scientist from Old Dominion University, who has written studies on voter fraud. For this trial, Richman was paid $5,000 by the taxpayers of Kansas to measure non-citizen registration in the state. Richman was the man who had to deliver the goods for Kobach.\n\nWith his gray-flecked beard and mustache, Richman looked the part of an academic, albeit one who seemed a bit too tall for his suit and who showed his discomfort in a series of awkward, sudden movements on the witness stand. At moments, Richman\u2019s testimony turned combative, devolving into something resembling an episode of The Jerry Springer Show. By the time he left the stand, Richman had testified for more than five punishing hours. He\u2019d bickered with the ACLU\u2019s lawyer, raised his voice as he defended his studies and repeatedly sparred with the judge.\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d shouted Robinson at one point, silencing a verbal free-for-all that had erupted among Richman, the ACLU\u2019s Ho, and Kobach, who were all speaking at the same time. \u201cEspecially you,\u201d she said, turning her stare to Richman. \u201cYou are not here to be an advocate. You are not here to trash the plaintiff. And you are not here to argue with me.\u201d\n\nRichman had played a small but significant part in the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump and others had cited his work to claim that illegal votes had robbed Trump of the popular vote. At an October 2016 rally in Wisconsin, the candidate cited Richman\u2019s work to bolster his predictions that the election would be rigged. \u201cYou don\u2019t read about this, right?\u201d Trump told the crowd, before reading from an op-ed Richman had written for The Washington Post: \u201c\u2018We find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in various close elections.\u2019 Okay? All right?\u201d\n\nRichman\u2019s 2014 study of non-citizen registration used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study \u2014 an online survey of more than 32,000 people. Of those, fewer than 40 individuals indicated they were non-citizens registered to vote. Based on that sample, Richman concluded that up to 2.8 million illegal votes had been cast in 2008 by non-citizens. In fact, he put the illegal votes at somewhere between 38,000 and 2.8 million \u2014 a preposterously large range \u2014 and then Trump and others simply used the highest figure.\n\nAcademics pilloried Richman\u2019s conclusions. Two hundred political scientists signed an open letter criticizing the study, saying it should \u201cnot be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting.\u201d Harvard\u2019s Stephen Ansolabehere, who administered the CCES, published his own peer-reviewed paper lambasting Richman\u2019s work. Indeed, by the time Trump read Richman\u2019s article onstage in 2016, The Washington Post had already appended a note to the op-ed linking to three rebuttals and a peer-reviewed study debunking the research.\n\nNone of that discouraged Kobach or Trump from repeating Richman\u2019s conclusions. They then went a few steps further. They took the top end of the range for the 2008 election, assumed that it applied to the 2016 election, too, and further assumed that all of the fraudulent ballots had been cast for Clinton.\n\nSome of those statements found their way into the courtroom, when Ho pressed play on a video shot by The Kansas City Star on Nov. 30, 2016. Kobach had met with Trump 10 days earlier and had brought with him a paper decrying non-citizen registration and voter fraud. Two days later, Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote if not for \u201cmillions of people who voted illegally.\u201d\n\nThen-President-elect Donald Trump and Kris Kobach meet at the Trump International Golf Club in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, on Nov. 20, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nOn the courtroom\u2019s televisions, Kobach appeared, saying Trump\u2019s tweet was \u201cabsolutely correct.\u201d Without naming Richman, Kobach referred to his study: The number of non-citizens who said they\u2019d voted in 2008 was far larger than the popular vote margin, Kobach said on the video. The same number likely voted again in 2016.\n\nIn the courtroom, Ho asked Richman if he believed his research supported such a claim. Richman stammered. He repeatedly looked at Kobach, seemingly searching for a way out. Ho persisted and finally, Richman gave his answer: \u201cI do not believe my study provides strong support for that notion.\u201d\n\nTo estimate the number of non-citizens voting in Kansas, Richman had used the same methodology he employed in his much-criticized 2014 study. Using samples as small as a single voter, he\u2019d produced surveys with wildly different estimates of non-citizen registration in the state. The multiple iterations confused everyone in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cFor the record, how many different data sources have you provided?\u201d Robinson interjected in the middle of one Richman answer. \u201cYou provide a range of, like, zero to 18,000 or more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sense the frustration,\u201d Richman responded, before offering a winding explanation of the multiple data sources and surveys he\u2019d used to arrive at a half-dozen different estimates. Robinson cut him off. \u201cMaybe we need to stop here,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYour honor, let me finish answering your question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m done,\u201d she responded, as he continued to protest. \u201cNo. Dr. Richman, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nTo refute Richman\u2019s numbers, the ACLU called on Harvard\u2019s Ansolabehere, whose data Richman had relied on in the past. Ansolabehere testified that Richman\u2019s sample sizes were so small that it was just as possible that there were no non-citizens registered to vote in Kansas as 18,000. \u201cThere\u2019s just a great deal of uncertainty with these estimates,\u201d he said.\n\nHo asked if it would be accurate to say that Richman\u2019s data \u201cshows a rate of non-citizen registration in Kansas that is not statistically distinct from zero?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nThe judge was harsher than Ansolabehere in her description of Richman\u2019s testimony. In her opinion, Robinson unloaded a fusillade of dismissive adjectives, calling Richman\u2019s conclusions \u201cconfusing, inconsistent and methodologically flawed,\u201d and adding that they were \u201ccredibly dismantled\u201d by Ansolabehere. She labeled elements of Richman\u2019s testimony \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cmisleading,\u201d and stated that she gave his research \u201cno weight\u201d in her decision.\n\nOne of the paradoxes of Kobach is that he has become a star in circles that focus on illegal immigration and voting fraud despite poor results in the courtroom. By ProPublica\u2019s count, Kobach chalked up a 2\u20136 won-lost record in federal cases in which he was played a major role, and which reached a final disposition before the Kansas case.\n\nThose results occurred when Kobach was an attorney for the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform from 2004 to 2011, when he became secretary of state in Kansas. In his FAIR role (in which he continued to moonlight till about 2014), Kobach traveled to places like Fremont, Nebraska, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Farmers Branch, Texas, and Valley Park, Missouri, to help local governments write laws that attempted to hamper illegal immigration, and then defend them in court. Kobach won in Nebraska, but lost in Texas and Pennsylvania, and only a watered down version of the law remains in Missouri.\n\nThe best-known law that Kobach helped shape before joining the Kansas government in 2011 was Arizona\u2019s \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law. That statute allowed police to demand citizenship documents for any reason from anyone they thought might be in the country illegally. After it passed, the state paid Kobach $300 an hour to train law enforcement on how to legally arrest suspected illegal immigrants. The Supreme Court gutted key provisions of the law in 2012.\n\nKobach also struggled in two forays into political campaigning. In 2004, he lost a race for Congress. He also drew criticism for his stint as an informal adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. Kobach was the man responsible for Romney\u2019s much-maligned proposal that illegal immigrants \u201cself-deport,\u201d one reason Romney attracted little support among Latinos. Romney disavowed Kobach even before the campaign was over, telling media outlets that he was a \u201csupporter,\u201d not an adviser.\n\nTrump\u2019s election meant Kobach\u2019s positions on immigration would be welcome in the White House. Kobach lobbied for, but didn\u2019t receive, an appointment as Secretary of Homeland Security. He was, however, placed in charge of the voter fraud commission, a pet project of Trump\u2019s. Facing a raft of lawsuits and bad publicity, the commission was disbanded little more than six months after it formally launched.\n\nBack at home, Kobach expanded his power as secretary of state. Boasting of his experience as a law professor and scholar, Kobach convinced the state legislature to give him the authority to prosecute election crimes himself, a power wielded by no other secretary of state. In that role, he has obtained nine guilty pleas against individuals for election-related misdemeanors. Only one of those who pleaded guilty, as it happens, was a non-citizen.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback signs a bill granting prosecuting power to the secretary of state for cases of voter fraud in Topeka, Kansas, on June 8, 2015, as Kris Kobach, back center, looks on. (Chris Neal/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nHe also persuaded Kansas\u2019 attorney general to allow Kobach to represent the state in the trial of Kansas\u2019 voting law. Kobach argued it was a bargain. As he told The Wichita Eagle at the time, \u201cThe advantage is the state gets an experienced appellate litigator who is a specialist in this field and in constitutional law for the cost the state is already paying, which is my salary.\u201d\n\nKobach fared no better in the second main area of the Kansas City trial than he had in the first. This part explored whether there is a less burdensome way of identifying non-citizens than forcing everyone to show proof of citizenship upon registration. Judge Robinson would conclude that there were many alternatives that were less intrusive.\n\nIn his opening, Ho of the ACLU spotlighted a potentially less intrusive approach. Why not use the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements System list, and compare the names on it to the Kansas voter rolls? That, Ho argued, could efficiently suss out illegal registrations.\n\nKobach told the judge that simply wasn\u2019t feasible. The list, he explained, doesn\u2019t contain all non-citizens in the country illegally \u2014 it contains only non-citizens legally present and those here illegally who register in some way with the federal government. Plus, he told Robinson, in order to really match the SAVE list against a voter roll, both datasets would have to contain alien registration numbers, the identifier given to non-citizens living in the U.S. \u201cThose are things that a voter registration system doesn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the SAVE system does not work.\u201d\n\nBut Kobach had made the opposite argument when he headed the voter fraud commission. There, he\u2019d repeatedly advocated the use of the SAVE database. Appearing on Fox News in May 2017, shortly after the commission was established, Kobach said, \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security knows of the millions of aliens who are in the United States legally and that data that\u2019s never been bounced against the state\u2019s voter rolls to see whether these people are registered.\u201d He said the federal databases \u201ccan be very valuable.\u201d\n\nA month later, as chief of the voting fraud commission, Kobach took steps to compare state information to the SAVE database. He sent a letter to all 50 secretaries of state requesting their voter rolls. Bipartisan outrage ensued. Democrats feared he would use the rolls to encourage states to purge legitimately registered voters. Republicans labelled the request federal overreach.\n\nAt trial, Kobach\u2019s main expert on this point was Hans von Spakovsky, another member of the voter fraud commission. He, too, had been eager in commission meetings to match state voter rolls to the SAVE database.\n\nBut like Kobach, von Spakovsky took a different tack at trial. He testified that this database was unusable by elections offices. \u201cIn your experience and expertise as an election administrator and one who studies elections,\u201d Kobach asked, \u201cis [the alien registration number] a practical or even possible thing for a state to do in its voter registration database?\u201d Von Spakovsky answered, \u201cNo, it is not.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky and Kobach have been friends for more than a decade. They worked together at the Department of Justice under George W. Bush. Kobach focused on immigration issues \u2014 helping create a database to register visitors to the U.S. from countries associated with terrorism \u2014 while von Spakovsky specialized in voting issues; he had opposed the renewal of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a member of the voter fraud commission (Douglas Graham/Roll Call/Getty Images)\n\nVon Spakovsky\u2019s history as a local elections administrator in Fairfax County, Va., qualified him as an expert on voting fraud. Between 2010 and 2012, while serving as vice chairman of the county\u2019s three-member electoral board, he\u2019d examined the voter rolls and found what he said were 300 registered non-citizens. He\u2019d pressed for action against them, but none came. Von Spakovsky later joined the Heritage Foundation, where he remains today, generating research that underpins the arguments of those who claim mass voter fraud.\n\nLike Richman, von Spakovsky seemed nervous on the stand, albeit not combative. He wore wire-rimmed glasses and a severe, immovable expression. Immigration is a not-so-distant feature of his family history: His parents \u2014 Russian and German immigrants \u2014 met in a refugee camp in American-occupied Germany after World War II before moving to the U.S.\n\nVon Spakovsky had the task of testifying about what was intended to be a key piece of evidence for Kobach\u2019s case: a spreadsheet of 38 non-citizens who had registered to vote, or attempted to register, in a 20-year period in Sedgwick County, Kansas.\n\nBut the 38 non-citizens turned out to be something less than an electoral crime wave. For starters, some of the 38 had informed Sedgwick County that they were non-citizens. One woman had sent her registration postcard back to the county with an explanation that it was a \u201cmistake\u201d and that she was not a citizen. Another listed an alien registration number \u2014 which tellingly begins with an \u201cA\u201d \u2014 instead of a Social Security number on the voter registration form. The county registered her anyway.\n\nWhen von Spakovsky took the stand, he had to contend with questions that suggested he had cherry-picked his data. (The judge would find he had.) In his expert report, von Spakovsky had referenced a 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office that polled federal courts to see how many non-citizens had been excused from jury duty for being non-citizens \u2014 a sign of fraud, because jurors are selected from voter rolls. The GAO report mentioned eight courts. Only one said it had a meaningful number of jury candidates who claimed to be non-citizens: \u201cbetween 1 and 3 percent\u201d had been dismissed on these grounds. This was the only court von Spakovsky mentioned in his expert report.\n\nHis report also cited a 2012 TV news segment from an NBC station in Fort Myers, Fla. Reporters claimed to have discovered more than 100 non-citizens on the local voter roll.\n\n\u201cNow, you know, Mr. von Spakovsky, don\u2019t you, that after this NBC report there was a follow-up by the same NBC station that determined that at least 35 of those 100 individuals had documentation to prove they were, in fact, United States citizens. Correct?\u201d Ho asked. \u201cI am aware of that now, yes,\u201d von Spakovsky replied.\n\nThat correction had been online since 2012 and Ho had asked von Spakovsky the same question almost two years before in a deposition before the trial. But von Spakovsky never corrected his expert report.\n\nUnder Ho\u2019s questioning, von Spakovsky also acknowledged a false assertion he made in 2011. In a nationally syndicated column for McClatchy, von Spakovsky claimed a tight race in Missouri had been decided by the illegal votes of 50 Somali nationals. A month before the column was published, a Missouri state judge ruled that no such thing had happened.\n\nOn the stand, von Spakovsky claimed he had no knowledge of the ruling when he published the piece. He conceded that he never retracted the assertion.\n\nKobach, who watched the exchange without objection, had repeatedly made the same claim \u2014 even after the judge ruled it was false. In 2011, Kobach wrote a series of columns using the example as proof of the need for voter ID, publishing them in outlets ranging from the Topeka Capital-Journal to the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. In 2012, he made the claim in an article published in the Syracuse Law Review. In 2013, he wrote an op-ed for the Kansas City Star with the same example: \u201cThe election was stolen when Rizzo received about 50 votes illegally cast by citizens of Somalia.\u201d None of those articles have ever been corrected.\n\nUltimately, Robinson would lacerate von Spakovsky\u2019s testimony, much as she had Richman\u2019s. Von Spakovsky\u2019s statements, the judge wrote, were \u201cpremised on several misleading and unsupported examples\u201d and included \u201cfalse assertions.\u201d As she put it, \u201cHis generalized opinions about the rates of noncitizen registration were likewise based on misleading evidence, and largely based on his preconceived beliefs about this issue, which has led to his aggressive public advocacy of stricter proof of citizenship laws.\u201d\n\nThere was one other wobbly leg holding up the argument that voter fraud is rampant: the very meaning of the word \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nKobach\u2019s case, and the broader claim, rely on an extremely generous definition. Legal definitions of fraud require a person to knowingly be deceptive. But both Kobach and von Spakovsky characterized illegal ballots as \u201cfraud\u201d regardless of the intention of the voter.\n\nIndeed, the nine convictions Kobach has obtained in Kansas are almost entirely made up of individuals who didn\u2019t realize they were doing something wrong. For example, there were older voters who didn\u2019t understand the restrictions and voted in multiple places they owned property. There was also a college student who\u2019d forgotten she\u2019d filled out an absentee ballot in her home state before voting months later in Kansas. (She voted for Trump both times.)\n\nLate in the trial, the ACLU presented Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers who has written extensively about voter fraud, as a rebuttal witness. Her book, \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud,\u201d concluded that almost all instances of illegal votes can be chalked up to misunderstandings and administrative error.\n\nKobach sent his co-counsel, Garrett Roe, to cross-examine her. \u201cIt\u2019s your view that what matters is the voter\u2019s knowledge that his or her action is unlawful?\u201d Roe asked. \u201cIn a definition of fraud, yes,\u201d said Minnite. Roe pressed her about this for several questions, seemingly surprised that she wouldn\u2019t refer to all illegal voting as fraud.\n\nMinnite stopped him. \u201cThe word \u2018fraud\u2019 has meaning, and that meaning is that there\u2019s intent behind it. And that\u2019s actually what Kansas laws are with respect to illegal voting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou keep saying my definition\u201d she said, putting finger quotes around \u201cmy.\u201d \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a freak definition.\u201d\n\nKobach had explored a similar line of inquiry with von Spakovsky, asking him if the list of 38 non-citizens he\u2019d reviewed could be absolved of \u201cfraud\u201d because they may have lacked intent.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d von Spakovsky replied, \u201cI think any time a non-citizen registers, any time a non-citizen votes, they are \u2014 whether intentionally or by accident, I mean \u2014 they are defrauding legitimate citizens from a fair election.\u201d\n\nAfter Kobach concluded his questions, the judge began her own examination of von Spakovsky.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a pretty good distinction in terms of how the two of you define fraud,\u201d the judge said, explaining that Minnite focused on intent, while she understood von Spakovsky\u2019s definition to include any time someone who wasn\u2019t supposed to vote did so, regardless of reason. \u201cWould that be a fair characterization?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d von Spakovsky replied.\n\nThe judge asked whether a greater number of legitimate voters would be barred from casting ballots under the law than fraudulent votes prevented. In that scenario, she asked, \u201cWould that not also be defrauding the electoral process?\u201d Von Spakovsky danced around the answer, asserting that one would need to answer that question in the context of the registration requirements, which he deemed reasonable.\n\nThe judge cut him off. \u201cWell that doesn\u2019t really answer my question,\u201d she said, saying that she found it contradictory that he wanted to consider context when examining the burden of registration requirements, but not when examining the circumstances in which fraud was committed.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about \u2026 non-citizen voting, you don\u2019t want to consider that in context of whether that person made a mistake, whether a DMV person convinced them they should vote,\u201d she said. Von Spakovsky allowed that not every improper voter should be prosecuted, but insisted that \u201ceach ballot they cast takes away the vote of and dilutes the vote of actual citizens who are voting. And that\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nThe judge interrupted again. \u201cSo, the thousands of actual citizens that should be able to vote but who are not because of the system, because of this law, that\u2019s not diluting the vote and that\u2019s not impairing the integrity of the electoral process, I take it?\u201d she said.\n\nVon Spakovsky didn\u2019t engage with the hypothetical. He simply didn\u2019t believe it was happening. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that this requirement prevents individuals who are eligible to register and vote from doing so.\u201d Later, on the stand, he\u2019d tell Ho he couldn\u2019t think of a single law in the country that he felt negatively impacted anyone\u2019s ability to register or vote.\n\nRobinson, in the end, strongly disagreed. As she wrote in her opinion, \u201cthe Court finds that the burden imposed on Kansans by this law outweighs the state\u2019s interest in preventing noncitizen voter fraud, keeping accurate voter rolls, and maintaining confidence in elections. The burden is not just on a \u2018few voters,\u2019 but on tens of thousands of voters, many of whom were disenfranchised\u201d by Kobach\u2019s law. The law, she concluded, was a bigger problem than the one it set out to solve, acting as a \u201cdeterrent to registration and voting for substantially more eligible Kansans than it has prevented ineligible voters from registering to vote.\u201d", "url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-kansas-trial"}, "article3": {"title": "There have been just four documented cases of voter fraud in the 2016 election", "content": "Gift Article Share\n\nThree weeks ago, the votes of more than 135 million Americans were counted, and Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election. It was a surprising result, given that polling in the run-up to the election suggested that Hillary Clinton's support in the Midwest would ensure that she could hit 270 electoral votes. That support didn't exist when it came time to vote, and that was that.\n\nIt seemed very likely as Nov. 8 approached that Trump was poised to reject the result, regardless of which states fell into which candidate's column. For months, he'd been alleging that voter fraud was rampant and that his supporters needed to police the polls. Rather amazingly, he has picked up the same thread after the election, charging that Clinton won the popular vote (by 2.5 million votes and counting) solely because of fraudulent ballots.\n\nThere wasn't evidence of widespread voter fraud before the election. There isn't evidence of widespread voter fraud afterward, either. In fact, there's not evidence of even modest voter fraud.\n\nSpeaking to The Washington Post Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he trusted the results of the election in his home state of California. \u201cI looked at this election. I saw the results come in. I trusted them (the results) just as I\u2019ve trusted them in the past,\u201d McCarthy said. \"I don\u2019t have a problem,\" Asked if he saw any signs of fraud, McCarthy did not say yes or no, but replied, \u201cI say let\u2019s govern.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t think a recount would make any difference in the election outcome. \u201cThe election to me is over,\" he said. (Washington Post Live) (Video: Washington Post Live)\n\nWe combed through the news-aggregation system Nexis to find demonstrated cases of absentee or in-person voter fraud \u2014 which is to say, examples of people getting caught casting a ballot that they shouldn't have cast \u2014 during this election. This excludes examples of voter registration fraud \u2014 the filing of fraudulent information. Those aren't votes cast \u2014 and given that organizations often provide incentives for employees to register as many people as possible, registration fraud cases (while still rare) are more common.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's what we found:\n\nCases of voter fraud\n\nA woman in Iowa who voted twice. Terri Lynn Rote had the enormous misfortune of bad timing. Right as the candidate she supported, Trump, was drawing attention to fraud cases, Rote decided to try to vote twice in Des Moines, and got caught. The case made national headlines simply by virtue of the fact that it happened when it did, and that she voted for Trump.\n\nFor what it's worth, she suggested that the fault lay with Trump. \u201cThe polls are rigged,\u201d she said to a local radio station by way of explaining her multiple votes, echoing another of Trump's complaints.\n\nA man in Texas who voted twice. Phillip Cook was arrested on Election Day after voting twice. He claimed to be an employee of Trump's campaign who was testing the security of the electoral system. He wasn't an employee of the campaign \u2014 and the polling location's security worked perfectly well, it seems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman who cast a ballot on behalf of her dead husband. Audrey Cook is a Republican election judge in Illinois. She and her husband applied for absentee ballots because he was ill. He died before completing his, so she filled it out for him and sent it in. The ballot will not be counted.\n\nA woman in Florida who marked absentee ballots. Gladys Coego was hired to open absentee ballots in Miami-Dade County. One of her co-workers noticed that she was going a step further, filling in the bubble for a mayoral candidate with a pen she had in her purse. She was caught in the act and arrested. There's no evidence that she changed any presidential votes.\n\nPossible cases of voter fraud\n\nTwo possible cases of fraud in Washington state. Investigators are looking at two possible cases of fraud near the Idaho border. In the first, a man may have signed his deceased wife's name on an absentee ballot; in the second, someone may have voted in both states. Charges have not been filed in either case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA possible case in South Carolina. A man in the Palmetto State is being investigated on suspicion of voting both by absentee ballot and in person.\n\nBallots are being challenged in North Carolina. Because of the close gubernatorial race in North Carolina, several dozen ballots were challenged by Republicans as having been cast by convicted felons in the state. An independent group found that at least 18 of the 43 alleged cases of fraud were not fraud at all, instead confusing valid voters with people who were ineligible given their status. There's not yet any verification that the other ballots were from ineligible voters, either.\n\nAnd that's the end of the list. We will happily add any other examples that people might offer, but note that we are looking only at voter fraud. That means that things such as the following don't count:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're looking only for cases in which someone is shown or alleged to have cast a ballot he or she should not have.\n\nWe can anticipate one response in advance: The fraud isn't being detected! It's certainly possible that we're missing cases (as above) and it's certainly possible that some cases as yet have gone unnoticed. That would have had to have happened despite the checks that are already in place and which caught the people implicated above, mind you. And it would have had to have happened during an election cycle where more attention was paid to voter security than any other in recent history. Catching Clinton voters casting fraudulent ballots would be a huge coup, particularly now! (After all, Trump himself said that it was Democrats who commit fraud, not Republicans.) But that doesn't seem to be happening.\n\nThe burden, as we've noted before, is on those who say rampant fraud is occurring. I can claim that there's a burglary epidemic in my city that has gone unnoticed, but you would be justified in pointing out that no one is coming forward to say their houses were broken into. And if I point at a recent spike in sales of crowbars as evidence \u2014 voter registration fraud, in this analogy \u2014 you would be right to draw a distinction between that and my initial claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of writing, there are four demonstrated examples of people committing voter fraud during the 2016 general election. That's 0.000002 percent of the ballots cast in the race for the White House \u2014 if they counted, which they won't. (And it's including the mayoral fraud in Florida.)\n\nThere is simply no evidence that fraudulent ballots played any significant role in the 2016 presidential election whatsoever.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/01/0-000002-percent-of-all-the-ballots-cast-in-the-2016-election-were-fraudulent/"}}
