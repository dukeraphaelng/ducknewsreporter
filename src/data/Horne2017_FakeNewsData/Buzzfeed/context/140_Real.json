{"foreign_id": "140_Real", "article1": {"title": "The rise of Donald Trump is a terrifying moment in American politics", "content": "On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. Twenty-four hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide.\n\nI'm not here to clutch my pearls over Trump's vulgarity; what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his \"she said it, I didn't\" game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him \u2014 it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic. But it was more than that. It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue's instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob.\n\nIt is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He's red-faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America's most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we've ever seen.\n\nIt's so fun to watch that it's easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is.\n\nTrump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament; he's a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he's also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it's hard to know if he even realizes he's lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash.\n\nTrump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He's not a joke and he's not a clown. He's a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace, who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted, who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations. This is not political entertainment. This is politics.\n\nTrump's path to power has been unnerving. His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence. He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them. He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement. He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers. He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period. He responded to rival Ted Cruz's surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims. When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,\" he brushed off complaints that he's inspiring violence by saying his supporters are \"very passionate.\"\n\nBehind Trump's success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger, resentment, and fear. His view of the economy is entirely zero-sum \u2014 for Americans to win, others must lose. \"We're going to make America great again,\" he said in his New Hampshire victory speech, \"but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're going to beat China, Japan, beat Mexico at trade. We're going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It's not going to happen anymore.\"\n\nTrump answers America's rage with more rage. As the journalist Molly Ball observed, \"All the other candidates say 'Americans are angry, and I understand.' Trump says, 'I\u2019M angry.'\" Trump doesn't offer solutions so much as he offers villains. His message isn't so much that he'll help you as he'll hurt them.\n\nTrump's other gift \u2014 the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important \u2014 is his complete lack of shame. It's easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they're exposed as liars, when they're seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested.\n\nTrump doesn't. He has the reality television star's ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won't, to say what others can't, to do what others wouldn't.\n\nTrump lives by the reality television trope that he's not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they're not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. \"I'm not here to make friends\" is another way of saying, \"I'm not bound by the social conventions of normal people.\" The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind.\n\nThis, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field. He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio, and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul. But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump; his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do \u2014 or what he wouldn't do.\n\nWhen MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who \"kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries,\" Trump replied, \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\" Later, he clarified that he doesn't actually condone killing journalists, but, he warned the crowd, \"I do hate them.\"\n\nIt's a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil, but it's a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is, or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it.\n\nBut tonight is a night to repeat it. There is something scary in Donald Trump. We should fear his rise.\n\nHear it first: The Ezra Klein Show\n\nEzra Klein goes in-depth with some of the biggest names in politics and media, every Tuesday.

The negative mail arriving at our door steps, TV ads that try to convince us of the impending doom if one candidate is elected over the other, the political hysteria across social media if one side loses. The election is near and so is the end of campaign season and all of this that comes with it. Or, is it? As of Wednesday, Nov. 7, get ready to gear up because we are the First in the Nation Primary State \u2013 the FITN \u2013 and presidential election 2020 will begin immediately.\n\nWe've already seen several potential Democratic presidential contenders in New Hampshire this fall. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Jeff Merkey of Oregon, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, AKA Spartacus, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and even lawyer-to-the-porn-star Michael Avenatti, have all made visits either campaigning with and for New Hampshire Democrats or just spreading the message of themselves and their party. Oh, and talking about that impending doom on the horizon if Republicans win anything on Tuesday.\n\nWhat's cool about New Hampshire, one of many things, is regardless of party, people care. Our electorate is active and involved in politics and the political process. According a report by Nonprofit VOTE and the U.S. Elections Project, 72.5 percent of eligible Granite Staters went to the polls in the 2016 general election. Compare that to the national average of 58 percent, and we have something to be proud of. This is why, in addition to would-be candidates, the \"603\" has the honor of hosting high-profile news makers of other kinds who want to engage with voters and check the temperature of an informed electorate. Bill Kristol is one such invitee that will arrive in New Hampshire the day after the election to analyze the outcomes. No, he's not running for president, at least that's what he says. I asked him.\n\nKristol is co-founder of the Weekly Standard, a conservative commentator and writer, and a frequent critic of President Donald Trump. That last part has gotten him in some hot water with high profile Republicans and social media warriors over the past two years.\n\nThe New Hampshire Journal and Southern New Hampshire University College Republicans host Kristol on Wednesday to \"examine the midterm results, explore the issues that will influence the political discourse heading toward 2020 and the future of the Republican Party.\" Ahead of his trip, Kristol joined me on my weekly podcast (Newscycle, by Gatehouse Media) for a broad discussion about the political climate, politics behind the headlines and a trove of other topics. I felt a kinship with him \u2013 being a Republican who, at times, disapproves of President Trump's actions or words.\n\nNow, I'm no Bill Kristol. The president has never called me out by name, or tweeted that I'm a \"dummy\" and a \"loser.\" The Washington Examiner has not provided me with the moniker of \"A leader of the Never Trump movement.\" We do, however, share an unfortunate experience. During our discussion, I asked him what it's been like as a very public figure and conservative, who has served in a Republican presidential administration, to be a dissenter against this president. His response, echoed my experience. \"It's been interesting but, fine. Thank God we're in America, we're not in Russia or some other country where people lock you up or poison you... I've lost a few older friends... they've sort of become acquaintances rather than friends. They find it annoying I would criticize the president.\"\n\nA few years ago, I would never have imagined I could lose friends over political disagreement, but it has happened far too frequently. Whether you are Bill Kristol or me, the fact it happens is a sad commentary on where we are as a society. Kristol discussed his time in the Reagan administration when there were Republicans who criticized President Reagan and voted against his policies, and they were still cordial to each other. They didn't become vicious enemies because they disagreed. Dissent is one of the greatest American rights and values we have and I can't grasp this new concept that not only opposes it, but vehemently denounces the very notion of it. As Kristol said, \"The tribalization of American politics is bad for public policy, but bad for the country really in terms of our civic culture.\" It sure is. \"Vigorous debate within parties is often the way American politics makes progress.\" Yes to that too.\n\nDespite this unnerving divisiveness, Kristol will come to New Hampshire to have the discussion too many of us are told we shouldn't have. He says the people of our state are used to the vigorous debate because we see it every four years. We are the #FITN, after all. I sure hope he's right about that part \u2013 that we can have vigorous debate leading up until Tuesday, and then go back to being friends again \u2013 at least until the next cycle really gets going. That truly is, or should be, the American way.", "url": "https://www.fosters.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2018/11/04/its-shame-to-lose-friends-over-politics/9330892007/"}, "article3": {"title": "Donald Trump bullied a man as overweight, then didn\u2019t apologize", "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nAt a 2020 campaign rally in New Hampshire on Thursday night, a protest broke out. A Trump supporter sought to remove the protesters. And as that was happening, the President of the United States yelled this into the microphone:\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s got a serious weight problem. Go home. Start exercising. Get him out of here please. Got a bigger problem than I do. Got a bigger problem than all of us. Now he goes home and his mom says, \u2018What the hell have you just done?\u2019\u201d\n\nYou can watch it here.\n\nFor anyone familiar with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, it\u2019s clear he misunderstood the situation. He regularly taunts protesters at his rallies by telling them to run home to their moms. Trump clearly thought the man escorting the protesters out was a protester himself, not a Trump supporter.\n\nBriefed on his mistake after the rally, Trump called the man and left a message thanking him for his support, according to CNN White House reporter Kaitlan Collins. But, as Kaitlan noted via Twitter:\n\n\u201cTrump did not apologize, a White House official tells me. He phoned the supporter, left him a message thanking him for his support, but did not use the words \u2018sorry\u2019 or \u2018apologize.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo, of course he didn\u2019t.\n\nHere are the things I find remarkable about all this:\n\n1) We have a President who thinks fat-shaming someone in front of thousands of people is a totally acceptable thing to do\n\n2) The crowd laughed and applauded when Trump made the comment about the man\u2019s weight\n\n3) Trump only decided to reach out to the man when informed he was a supporter\n\n4) The White House went out of its way to make clear that Trump did not apologize to the man\n\nBoy oh boy. What a commentary on this moment in time in American politics and culture.\n\nTrump mainstreamed bullying as a political tactic during the 2016 primary campaign, so no one should be surprised that, as President, he talks like this. But it does serve as yet another reminder that the biggest difference between Trump and those who have held the office before him is that he absolutely rejects the idea of the presidency as a beacon of moral leadership.\n\nHis reaction to the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, proved that. His mocking of a disabled reporter on the campaign trail in 2016 proved it. His comments about immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d proved it. His insistence that Mexico was sending rapists and criminals to the United States proved it. His decision to call Baltimore \u201crat-infested\u201d proved it. And on and on it goes.\n\nWhat Trump has done is not only ignore the idea that a president of the United States should take the high road, but also made a mockery of the very idea. He champions his low-roaded mindset every chance he gets, wearing it as a badge of honor to his supporters.\n\nTo Trump, and those who laugh and jeer right along with him, his willingness to break with standards of accepted behavior speaks to how radical a change he is to a staid and broken political system and culture. What it really is though is just rude. And bullying. Putting someone else down to make yourself feel better isn\u2019t presidential. It isn\u2019t polite. And it shouldn\u2019t be acceptable \u2013 regardless of your partisan views.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/donald-trump-fat-new-hampshire-rally/index.html"}}
