Biti was arrested for treason and detained for a month after daring to suggest his party had defeated President Robert Mugabe in a vote in 2008.\n\nZimbabwe ruling ZANU (PF) supporters cheer for President Robert Mugabe upon his arrival at Harare International airport, July 4, 2008. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo\n\n\u201cThey denied me food. They beat me up. They put me in leg irons. They beat me in the private parts,\u201d Biti, a lawyer who later served as finance minister in an eventual unity government, told Reuters. \u201cThat\u2019s real election rigging.\u201d\n\nTo opposition figures in Africa, and in other parts of the world that lack the 240-year U.S. history of peaceful transitions of power, Trump\u2019s assertion that November\u2019s U.S. presidential election will be \u201crigged\u201d, and his declaration that he may not accept the outcome, are dangerous words.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere,\u201d Biti said.\n\n\u201cHe has no idea what he\u2019s talking about, absolutely no idea,\u201d said Biti, who speaks from the experience of three election defeats to Mugabe, a 92-year-old ex-guerrilla who has run Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. \u201cIt makes us cross because in Africa there\u2019s real election rigging.\u201d\n\nLong-serving rulers who have faced U.S. criticism in the past are already using Trump\u2019s remarks to counter Washington\u2019s pro-democracy message.\n\nWhen Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power for 30 years, won re-election to his seventh term in February, U.S. officials accused his government of arresting opposition figures, harassing their supporters and intimidating the media.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, said Museveni\u2019s spokesman Don Wanyama, \u201cshould be an eye-opener to them. As they sit down to lecture other countries, they should realise that it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocracy is a process and it really takes time.\u201d\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nHORRIFIED\n\nTrump refused during a debate on Wednesday to say whether he would respect the result of the Nov. 8 poll. That sent a chill down the spine of Musikari Kombo, a former local government minister in Kenya, where 1,500 people were killed in a wave of ethnic bloodletting unleashed by disputes over the result of a 2007 election.\n\n\u201cI was shocked. I was horrified,\u201d Kombo said. \u201cPeople in Africa who have always challenged elections will say: \u2018You see, we are vindicated. Even in the Mother of all Democracies, the presidential candidate is not willing to accept because there is rigging.\u2019\u201d\n\nU.S. officials, including state governors from Trump\u2019s own Republican Party, say there is no serious vote fraud problem in the United States and the election will be clean.\n\nNevertheless, Trump and some allies have alleged anomalies in the voter roll in cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago that could allow the votes of dead people to be counted on behalf of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt is hard to think what they would have made of this year\u2019s election in Gabon, where opposition leader Jean Ping cried foul after narrowly losing to President Ali Bongo, whose family have ruled the oil-producing former French colony for half a century.\n\nThe focus of Ping\u2019s concern was the province of Haut-Ogooue, where results showed 95.46 percent of voters backed Bongo on a turnout of 99.9 percent, more than double anywhere else.\n\nGabon\u2019s constitutional court - led by the long-time mistress of Bongo\u2019s father, Omar - upheld the result.\n\n\u201cI would say to Mr. Trump \u2018Come to Gabon to see what a fake democracy looks like, to see what a stolen election looks like,\u2019\u201d said Alexandre Barro Chambrier, a senior Ping adviser.\n\n\u201cThere is no democracy here. There is the rule of one family and one man imposing a dictatorial regime,\u201d he added. \u201cMr Trump is not serious.\u201d", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-trump-rigging-africa-idUKKCN12K24M"}, "article2": {"title": "Donald Trump's unsettling record of comments about his daughter Ivanka", "content": "Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She\u2019s hot, right?\u201d\n\nThat anecdote, told to the New York Times by Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, appears to be the first recorded incident of the Republican presidential candidate and reality TV star making comments about his daughter\u2019s body which those present have deemed inappropriate.\n\nIn the almost 20 years since, Mr Trump has called his eldest daughter \u201cvoluptuous\u201d. He\u2019s said it\u2019s OK to describe her as \u201ca piece of ass\u201d, though she is a senior executive in his business empire. And he\u2019s said that, if she wasn\u2019t his daughter, \u201cperhaps [he\u2019d] be dating her\u201d.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s history of denigrating women has come to fore of the US presidential debate, after audio tapes emerged of him boasting about \u201cgrabbing them by the p***y\u201d from a 2005 recording of Access Hollywood.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of all the way he has spoken about one of the most important women in his life, Ivanka Trump.\n\nOn The Howard Stern Show, 2003\n\nDonald Trump bragged about his then-22-year-old daughter\u2019s body, saying: \u201cYou know who\u2019s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka.\n\n\u201cMy daughter, Ivanka. She\u2019s 6 feet tall, she\u2019s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model\u2014a tremendous amount.\u201d\n\nNew York magazine interview, December 2004\n\n\u201cLet me tell you one thing: Ivanka is a great, great beauty. Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter. But she\u2019s got a boyfriend.\u201d\n\nTrump family members listen to the second debate, (from L-R) wife Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, and sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. (Getty Images) (Getty)\n\nOn The Howard Stern Show, 2004\n\nMr Trump replies in the affirmative when host Howard Stern asks him if he can call Ivanka \"a piece of ass\u201d.\n\nTrump: \u201cMy daughter is beautiful, Ivanka.\"\n\nStern: \u201cBy the way, your daughter\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201c - she\u2019s beautiful\"\n\nStern: \u201cCan I say this? A piece of ass.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nOn The View, 2006\n\nDonald and Ivanka appeared together on The View while promoting Season Three of The Apprentice, in which Mr Trump\u2019s children featured for the first time as his advisors.\n\nWhen asked how he would react if Ivanka, a former teen model, posed for Playboy, Trump replied, \"It would be really disappointing \u2014 not really \u2014 but it would depend on what's inside the magazine.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.\"\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that terrible? How terrible? Is that terrible?\u201d\n\nOn The Howard Stern Show, October 2006\n\nStern remarks that Ivanka \u201clooks more voluptuous than ever\u201d, and asked if she has received breast implants. Trump engages in the discussion, saying she has not.\n\n\u201cShe's actually always been very voluptuous,\u201d Trump responds. \u201cShe's tall, she's almost 6 feet tall and she's been, she's an amazing beauty.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump's most controversial quotes Show all 14 1 / 14 Donald Trump's most controversial quotes Donald Trump's most controversial quotes On Isis: \"Some of the candidates, they went in and didn\u2019t know the air conditioner didn\u2019t work and sweated like dogs, and they didn\u2019t know the room was too big because they didn\u2019t have anybody there.

At that time he was not considered likely to win the presidency.\n\nIn a leaked diplomatic telegram, sent on Nov. 9 and printed in the Sunday Times newspaper, Britain\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, said he believed Britain had built better relationships with Trump\u2019s team than other foreign diplomats.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\n\u201c(Trump) is above all an outsider and an unknown quantity, whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts, but will surely evolve and, particularly, be open to outside influence if pitched right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be well placed to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGROW UP\u201d\n\nWhile the British government has congratulated Trump on his election, the head of the opposition, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he should \u201cgrow up\u201d on the immigration issue and recognize that the U.S. economy depends on migrant workers.\n\n\u201cThe treatment of Mexico by the United States, just as much as its absurd and abusive language towards Muslims, is something that has to be challenged and should be challenged,\u201d Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nUKIP, which has only one member of parliament in London, said Farage and Trump spent more than an hour discussing Trump\u2019s victory, global politics and Brexit.\n\nA UKIP official has suggested Farage could even be the next ambassador to the United States, but British media reported that May\u2019s office rejected the idea of any role for Farage, citing unnamed sources who described him as an \u201cirrelevance\u201d.\n\nA day after Trump\u2019s election victory, Farage called on the real estate mogul to reverse \u201cloathsome\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s policy by making Britain his top priority.\n\nFarage said he had been pleased at Trump\u2019s \u201cvery positive reaction\u201d to the idea that a bust of former British prime minister Winston Churchill be put back in the Oval Office.\n\nHe has also joked about sexual assault allegations against Trump, urging him to \u201cschmooze\u201d May but not touch her.
