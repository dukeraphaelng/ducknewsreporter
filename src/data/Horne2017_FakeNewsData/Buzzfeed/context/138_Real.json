In her critics\u2019 eyes it\u2019s just another example of the Clinton family taking ethical shortcuts and playing by their own set of fast-and-loose rules; her supporters say it\u2019s another example of the hysterical near-insanity that motivates her attackers in which, after millions of dollars in investigations, congressional hearings, FBI interviews and more, the scandal has amounted to little more than a whopping nothing-burger.\n\nBut until last week, the American public had never really had the chance to know how it all happened.\n\nThen, last Friday, the FBI released the final batch of what amount to nearly 250 pages of interview notes and reports collected during the course of its investigation. Agents interviewed officials ranging from former Secretary of State Colin Powell to CIA officers to the IT staffer who first rented a minivan to drive the server from Washington to the Clintons\u2019 home in New York. The files also include the FBI\u2019s forensic investigative process and never-before-seen details of the staff decisions that led to the server, the mechanics of Clinton\u2019s email system, and the confusing and balky State Department processes that led a technophobic Clinton to embrace her own BlackBerry. The FBI interviewed both those who supported her and those who questioned her decisions, as well as plenty of disinterested public servants who had no allegiance or beef with her either way. While the interviews were not technically conducted \u201cunder oath\u201d \u2014 lying to federal agents is itself a crime, as is obstruction of justice \u2014 they do open a uniquely candid window into how the decisions around Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server unfolded. They may be as close to the actual truth as we may ever get.\n\nThe interviews\u2014taken together and reconstructed for this article into the first-ever comprehensive narrative of how her email server scandal unfolded\u2014draw a picture of the controversy quite different from what either side has made it out to be. Together, the documents, technically known as Form 302s, depict less a sinister and carefully calculated effort to avoid transparency than a busy and uninterested executive who shows little comfort with even the basics of technology, working with a small, harried inner circle of aides inside a bureaucracy where the IT and classification systems haven\u2019t caught up with how business is conducted in the digital age. Reading the FBI\u2019s interviews, Clinton\u2019s team hardly seems organized enough to mount any sort of sinister cover-up. There\u2019s scant oversight of the way Clinton communicated, and little thought given to how her files might be preserved for posterity\u2014MacBook laptops with outdated archives are FedExed across the country, cutting-edge iPads are discarded quickly and BlackBerry devices are rejected for being \u201ctoo heavy\u201d as staff scrambled to cater to Clinton\u2019s whims.\n\nWhereas President Barack Obama has long publicly cultivated his geek persona, embracing new technologies, trying new tools and generally trying to prove his tech savvy, Hillary Clinton comes across in the FBI interviews as a disengaged tech user who sees the communication tools as little more than a means to an end. She has, according to multiple aides, never even learned how to use a desktop computer. Clinton regularly pumped those around her for help with her devices\u2014even those, as her long-time aide Philippe Reines joked to the FBI, whose job had \u201czero percent\u201d of their responsibilities focused on IT. Reines, whose name is redacted in the FBI files but whose identity is easily discernible, \u201clikened it to your parents asking for technical help with their phone or computer.\u201d\n\nExcept that what Clinton turned to others for help with wasn\u2019t an Amazon purchase or reading CNN.com: She needed help managing a massive trove of communications about the inner workings of the nation\u2019s diplomacy and national security. Over the course of five years, those emails lived first in her Chappaqua, New York, basement, then later in a data center in New Jersey, then they were FedExed across the country and possibly copied onto a thumb drive before being printed out, sorted and handed back to the State Department in 12 bankers\u2019 boxes. The boxes soon found themselves at the center of an FBI investigation and led ultimately to the biggest controversy to shadow Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. But it all started with the strange home server. This is its story.\n\nNote: FBI Form 302 reports are interview summaries by trained agents. Quotes in the following account are taken from the reports and usually represent the agents\u2019 summaries rather than the verbatim words of the interviewees.\n\n***\n\n\n\n1. The rules\n\nIt all began, according to the story told by Hillary Clinton and her aides, as \u201ca matter of a convenience\" after Clinton was named Barack Obama's first secretary of state. As Huma Abedin\u2014Clinton\u2019s most loyal aide\u2014explained to the FBI during an interview in April 2016, the State Department told Clinton\u2019s team during its January 2009 transition to Foggy Bottom that its tech experts didn\u2019t allow personal email accounts to be installed on government-issued devices.\n\nClinton didn\u2019t like the idea of carrying around two devices\u2014one for official government work and one for personal or political correspondence, which is discouraged on government accounts. So she opted instead to carry only a single device, a personal BlackBerry, linked to a newly registered email account on a private domain, clintonemail.com, that was run off a recycled server from her unsuccessful presidential bid the year before.\n\nThe decision to create a dedicated email setup for the former First Lady had evidently begun earlier, at the conclusion of her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, even before it was clear that her victorious opponent, Barack Obama, would enlist her help in a key role in his Cabinet.\n\nAt the end of 2008, it fell to a longtime Clinton family aide named Justin Cooper to figure out how Hillary Clinton should receive email. Cooper, an American University alum who had joined Bill Clinton\u2019s White House in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, finished the presidency working on the Oval Office operations staff. He and another aide, Doug Band, were among the close aides that President Clinton asked to move to New York to help set up his post-presidential life. Cooper helped edit the president\u2019s autobiography and then stayed on, attending Fordham Law School on the side, while helping to manage the day-to-day administrative details of the Clinton family, a job that included many of their financial details like credit cards and, according to a 2006 New Yorker profile of the former president, managing his bags and gifts while he traveled the world.\n\nIn 2008, the Clintons had two primary email domains: wjcoffice.com, which was mostly a legacy domain that auto-forwarded emails to more modern accounts, and presidentclinton.com, which was used by the staff for their email accounts. The email domains were run off of a basic Apple server in the Clintons\u2019 basement in Chappaqua that Cooper had purchased while Hillary was still running for president. Hillary Clinton, though, had never had an email account on either domain; [email protected], after all, would have seemed at first presumptuous and, by late 2008, a mean joke of an email address to assign her.\n\nThe Clinton's house in Chappaqua. | Getty\n\nDuring her tenure as U.S. senator from New York, she had used two different emails tied to her BlackBerry, [email protected], which later became [email protected] when AT&T took over Cingular. There\u2019d been little thought to archiving her emails\u2014AT&T didn\u2019t save users\u2019 emails\u2014and they disappeared whenever she changed devices, which she did frequently. Cooper had purchased her a MacBook laptop in 2008, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever used it.\n\nCooper says he knew that the Apple server was already outdated by late 2008\u2014Apple didn\u2019t seem to integrate well with BlackBerry\u2019s mail system\u2014and as Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign was being dismantled, Huma Abedin suggested Cooper talk with one of its IT staffers, Bryan Pagliano, about using some of its leftover computer equipment to update the Clinton family server. Pagliano agreed to build a server setup for the Clintons and began to rummage around, collecting equipment, network switches and the various components of a modern email system from the leftovers at Clinton\u2019s Arlington campaign headquarters. At the time, as Pagliano later told the FBI, he didn\u2019t realize Hillary Clinton would even have an account on the server\u2014he thought it would just be for the use of the existing team of Bill Clinton\u2019s aides.\n\nAt the same time, Abedin and Cooper were discussing what to do with the former first lady\u2019s email. Cooper and Abedin\u2014who had long served much the same purpose for Hillary as Cooper had served for Bill\u2014discussed between them the advantages of a \u201ccovert email domain versus a domain including the Clinton name.\u201d Abedin ultimately \u201cblessed off\u201d on using a new domain, @clintonemail.com, to handle the senator\u2019s email. On January 13, 2009, almost two months after Clinton accepted Obama\u2019s nomination, Cooper used an Internet registrar named Network Solutions to register that domain. The next week, Hillary Clinton resigned her Senate seat and was sworn into office as the nation\u2019s 67th secretary of state.\n\nThe Clinton team\u2019s arrival in Foggy Bottom was harried, like all administration transitions, but came with the extra complication that she intended to install two deputy secretaries of state. That decision required physically rejiggering the seventh floor of the State Department headquarters that houses the leadership\u2019s offices, a historic, wood-paneled area known internally as \u201cMahogany Row.\u201d\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s early days in office, there were various conversations among Clinton, her team and career State Department officials about her preferences and how to set up communications to aid her. There was a crucial complication: BlackBerrys\u2014the tools that Clinton and her aides had come to rely upon in the Senate and on the campaign trail\u2014weren\u2019t allowed inside Mahogany Row. This section of the State Department was technically considered a \u201cSensitive Compartmented Information Facility,\u201d government-speak for an eavesdropping-proofed room. The assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, Eric Boswell, later stated he never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry inside the secure area, but that among the State Department team there was some \u201cgeneral concern\u201d that Clinton\u2019s team might use the BlackBerrys that they\u2019d relied on so heavily during the campaign. His team made clear that the devices were prohibited.\n\nYet something was going to have to change: Hillary Clinton, after all, didn\u2019t know how to use a desktop computer. A BlackBerry was her lifeline. As Cheryl Mills told FBI agents later, \u201cClinton was not computer savvy and thus was not accustomed to using a computer, so efforts were made to try to figure out a system that would allow Clinton to operate as she did before DoS.\u201d\n\nState Department officials presented Clinton\u2019s team with a memo on January 24, 2009, outlining various options, suggesting if Clinton wanted to check her email, she would have to either physically walk out of her office to use her BlackBerry, or the State Department could set up a dedicated computer for her. Jake Sullivan, a foreign policy expert from the campaign who had grown to become one of Clinton\u2019s most trusted advisors, immediately saw problems with the proposal and echoed Mills\u2019 concern: \u201cClinton did not know how to use a computer, so the suggestion of a stand-alone computer for Clinton was not an appropriate solution.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Lewis Lukens, the department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for the Executive Secretariat\u2014the unit that oversaw the logistics for State\u2019s leadership\u2014sent an email asking about the possibility of setting up a \u201cliving room\u201d outside the office\u2019s secure area where the new secretary could check her email. There was a model for this; something similar had been done for Colin Powell.\n\nInstead, after much back and forth and various proposals, the solution turned out to be a simple one. During her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton\u2014who was known to her security detail by the code name Evergreen\u2014would deposit her BlackBerry into a desk drawer at the Diplomatic Security station outside her office when she arrived on the seventh floor. The practice of leaving the BlackBerry at the guard station, known as Post-1, was technically a security violation\u2014the desk was considered inside the Mahogany Row secure area\u2014but it seemed to those involved an appropriate compromise. To use it, she\u2019d leave her office and wander, often visiting State\u2019s eighth-floor balcony.\n\nIn the days after she was sworn in, Hillary Clinton also contacted her predecessor, Colin Powell, to ask how he had managed his information flow as secretary of state from 2001 to 2005. In his early weeks, Powell recalled, he\u2019d \u201creceived several security briefings that restricted his ability to communicate.\u201d He\u2019d questioned the NSA and CIA on \u201cwhy PDAs were anymore of a risk than the television remote controls.\u201d He never got a convincing answer. And so, he advised Hillary Clinton \u201cto resist restrictions that would inhibit her ability to communicate.\u201d But he told her to choose wisely and not to create an unnecessary paper trail. He said if it became \u201cpublic\u201d that Clinton had a BlackBerry and she used it to \u201cdo business,\u201d her emails could become \u201cofficial record[s] and subject to the law.\u201d As Powell said: \u201cBe very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.\u201d\n\nHillary on her Blackberry at a forum in Busan, South Korea. | Getty\n\nIt was all advice Clinton was probably predisposed to take\u2014in part because she eschewed technology herself. According to Cooper, \u201cClinton [as senator] usually carried a flip phone along with her BlackBerry because it was more comfortable for communications and Clinton was able to use her BlackBerry while talking on the flip phone.\u201d But at State, she gave up the flip phone, conducting most discussions in person, reading most documents in printed hard copy, or using one of the three phones in her Mahogany Row office: A black phone, capable of making secure and unsecure calls, a yellow one used only for secure conversations, and a dedicated white phone for direct calls to certain government officials. She never had a computer or fax machine in her office.\n\nMeanwhile, State Department IT and security teams were busy installing secure rooms in her two homes for reading and receiving material and conducting telephone conversations. Each house had its own SCIF. At Whitehaven\u2014her brick Georgian-style house in northwest Washington\u2014a State Department worker removed one of the regular doors on a third-floor room of the house, replaced it with a metal door secured by a key code lock, and outfitted the room inside with secure communications. A similar room was created at Chappaqua; while she rarely used the secure room at Whitehaven \u2014preferring to just go into the office if she had work to do\u2014she relied heavily on the one in Chappaqua when she was in New York, in part because cellphone coverage in the area was so poor that she needed the use of the SCIF\u2019s phone. (The FBI interview reports differ on who precisely had access to Clinton\u2019s home SCIFs\u2014whether it was just Clinton herself or also top aides like Abedin.)\n\nEach secure room was also equipped with a secure fax, but while Clinton was supposed to pick up the faxes herself at home, she often struggled to use the technology and had to rely on staff for help operate the machines. As one aide described it, Clinton \u201cwasn\u2019t very tech savvy and would get frustrated with the process.\u201d\n\n***\n\n2. The setup\n\nBy March of 2009, Bryan Pagliano\u2014who ultimately joined the State Department himself, working on IT programs related to mobile computing, teleworking and Bluetooth security vulnerabilities\u2014had assembled all the components for the Clinton email server. He rented a minivan in Washington, loaded it full, and drove north on I-95, meeting Cooper at the Clinton residence in Chappaqua. The two men then lugged load after load of computers into the basement.\n\nWhen he got into the basement for the first time, Pagliano laid eyes on the system that had been running the Clinton email until then: a basic Apple computer, connected to an HP printer used by Bill Clinton\u2019s staff to print documents remotely for him from his primary post-presidential office in Harlem, which sat about 35 miles south.\n\nPagliano didn\u2019t like the idea of housing the email server in a residential basement, because there was only a single unreliable Internet connection, but Cooper wanted physical access to the server. Pagliano told the FBI that he always thought it should be in a data center for \u201csecurity and reliability.\u201d But Cooper saw a series of advantages to housing it at Chappaqua rather than with the rest of the IT infrastructure at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s office in Harlem: It helped segregate the family\u2019s personal and political work from the foundation, and it minimized the number of people who could physically access the server. He also worried that an outside vendor might not report hacking attempts on the server, so preferred to rely on an in-house team of just him and Pagliano.\n\nThe two men loaded in a standard 12-unit server rack and the other hardware: a Kiwi Syslog Server, Cisco Private Internet eXchange firewall, a 3-terabyte hard drive and a power supply. Pagliano set up a Windows Small Business Server, as well as a BlackBerry Enterprise Server to run the Clinton devices. Cooper, meanwhile, registered a so-called SSL certificate to secure the server at Pagliano\u2019s direction. Later, Pagliano assessed the setup as a \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cB+\u201d email server.\n\nPagliano began the migration of the email accounts from the old server to the new one at the house, then finished it up later in his hotel room. When he finished, Pagliano believed he\u2019d \u201cpopped out\u201d all of the Clinton staff email from the Apple server; he recalled that he didn\u2019t transfer an email account for Hillary Clinton. The leftover Apple computer, meanwhile, was repurposed as a desktop for the household staff in Chappaqua. On the new system, Pagliano and Cooper both had administrative privileges. A backup system ran once a week.\n\nOn March 18, 2009, Hillary Clinton stopped using her longstanding email, [email protected], and switched to a new account: [email protected]. When she switched accounts, all of her old email disappeared\u2014including all of the email from her first seven weeks as secretary of state. To date, neither Clinton nor the FBI have located any of her email from that period.\n\nThat spring, Pagliano, while he was working on the email server, noticed that a new account had been created, labeled simply \u201cH.\u201d He asked Cooper who it was for; Cooper told him that it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s new email.\n\n***\n\n3. The technophobe\n\nHillary Clinton, for her part, proved remarkably uninterested and unfamiliar with new technology. By time she moved into Foggy Bottom, much of the world had jumped aboard the iPhone bandwagon, but Clinton would cling stubbornly to her BlackBerry, even as the once-ubiquitous Washington icon slid toward tech oblivion.\n\nAccording to Abedin, \u201cIt was not uncommon for Clinton to use a new BlackBerry for a few days and then immediately switch it out for an older version with which she was more familiar.\u201d She deemed one upgraded BlackBerry \u201ctoo heavy.\u201d That personal preference proved challenging because she churned through devices at a steady clip\u2014all told, the FBI figured that she\u2019d used around a dozen BlackBerrys during her tenure at the State Department. While she never reported losing a BlackBerry, Clinton replaced one after she spilled coffee on it, another because its trackball started to fail slowly over time, and another when its screen cracked.\n\nAides would help set up the new devices and sync them with the email server; Cooper recalled disposing of old devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer. Clinton didn\u2019t know her own email login information, so Hanley would generally enter the information as necessary, change the password, and tell Abedin, Cooper and Pagliano about a new password.\n\nClinton at one time requested a secure BlackBerry \u201cafter hearing President Obama had one,\u201d but ultimately the State Department decided that it wasn\u2019t feasible to give her one. Instead, her device of preference ended up being the BlackBerry Curve 8310, because the trackball feature was easier than the track pad on newer models like the BlackBerry 8700G, which she tried and rejected. Thus, as the BlackBerrys were upgraded, it became harder to find the style Clinton liked. Hanley said she generally purchased the devices from the AT&T store in Dupont Circle, though one came from Pentagon City Mall, and, later, she started to purchase them proactively to help ensure Clinton\u2019s preference would be available. (She even recalled at one point turning to eBay or Amazon to purchase one.) After buying a device, she\u2019d file for a reimbursement from the Clintons\u2019 personal funds, managed by Justin Cooper in New York.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t she have a State Department email address? That remains, to a certain extent, a mystery in the FBI files. At the beginning of the administration, the Executive Secretariat\u2019s Office of Information Resource Management (S/ES-IRM)\u2014the unit in the State Department that oversees information technology for the department\u2019s top leadership\u2014did offer the new incoming secretary a State.gov email address. But someone\u2014exactly who is lost to history\u2014on Clinton\u2019s team declined. (Over the course of her tenure, the unit did create two email addresses for her, but neither was used personally. One address, [email protected], was used to send all-employee emails, while another, [email protected], was used to run the Outlook calendar and schedule meetings.)\n\nHer preference for a personal email account was not technically against the rules. At State, FBI agents later found, there was \u201cno restriction on use of personal email accounts for official business,\u201d but employees were cautioned about security and records retention concerns. The State Department told employees that they should forward such emails to their official accounts for recordkeeping purposes. \u201cThere were no rules in place that specifically denied Secretary Clinton the use of her private network,\u201d but, according to the State Department IG Steve Linick, private email was \u201chighly discouraged.\u201d\n\nOfficially \u201cdiscouraged,\u201d sure, but according to many that the FBI interviewed, the State Department\u2019s culture uniquely embraced\u2014and its poor information systems actively seemed to encourage\u2014employees turning to private emails to conduct business. As FBI Director James Comey said in July when he reported the bureau\u2019s findings: \u201cWe also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.\u201d\n\n4. The state of State\n\nColin Powell had originally been shocked when he arrived at Foggy Bottom in 2001\u2014he immediately realized that one of the largest problems he faced was the State Department\u2019s outdated computer systems. At the time, the CIA and the State Department swapped responsibility for embassy communications every 12 months, an inefficient system that had caused the department to lose ground technologically. After Powell reviewed the situation, he worked out a deal with CIA Director George Tenet and \u201cfired\u201d his own State Department IT team, handing sole responsibility over to the CIA. More broadly, though, few State Department employees had their own computers\u2014and Powell himself found himself facing a laptop in his office with a 56k modem, sluggish even then.\n\nPowell invested in 44,000 new computers, giving every employee a computer on the desk, and monitored the adoption of the new systems as he traveled by conducting unofficial audits, sitting down at embassies overseas to check his own email and attempting to log into his account. As he told FBI agents, \u201cThis action allowed Powell to gauge if the embassy staff was maintaining and using their computers.\u201d He also regularly checked the department\u2019s internal \u201cCountry Notes\u201d on the intranet to see if missions overseas were keeping their details up to date.\n\nPowell personally preferred to use his own AOL address for email, treating it, he told the FBI, \u201clike a home telephone line.\u201d | Getty\n\nWhile during Powell\u2019s tenure, the State Department rolled out a new unclassified email system called OpenNet, Powell personally preferred to use his own AOL address for email, treating it, he told the FBI, \u201clike a home telephone line,\u201d meaning that he felt he could use it for business or personal reasons. He regularly corresponded with foreign leaders by email, switching to secure calls if the conversations turned sensitive. (When he finished his term as secretary of state, Powell told the FBI, \u201che took no emails with him when he left State and knew of no official record requirements at the time.\u201d)\n\nAll of Powell\u2019s investment had taken the State Department only so far. By the time Clinton arrived, the State Department\u2019s technology infrastructure was still outdated and balky. The \u201cfob\u201d system that was supposed to allow access to email outside the building\u2014whereby employees would enter a special key or token to confirm their identity\u2014was slow and prone to shutting down inconveniently. For employees who did use their official accounts, workarounds were common\u2014particularly because many State Department officials and senior leadership, many of whom worked from the field or traveled regularly on missions overseas, didn\u2019t have easy, regular access to the systems designed to transmit classified information securely.\n\nOne State employee told the FBI he regularly used nonsecure email and personal email simply because there was no other way to quickly transmit information. The FBI found \u201cmany DoS employees used personal email accounts because they were more easily accessible.\u201d Clinton aide Monica Hanley told the FBI that \u201cher state.gov email account was not as easily accessible as her Gmail account and on some occasions she used Gmail when she could not access her State.gov account.\u201d There were particularly problems connecting to State.gov accounts on board the Air Force planes that Clinton used to travel, so staff often would use Gmail or other personal accounts while traveling.\n\nAs the FBI report concluded, \u201cDoS does not have a restriction on the use of personal email accounts for official business. Personal email accounts are often used by individuals in the field who were not issued an official DoS mobile device, or who do not have the time or means to remotely log into the DoS system. Employees are not required to notify DoS that they are using a personal account for official business and there is no mechanism to track who is using a personal email.\u201d\n\nEven though the State Department\u2019s unclassified network had been penetrated by at least one foreign adversary\u2014exactly who isn\u2019t revealed in the FBI notes\u2014employees had actually come to rely on email even more as time passed, which meant playing fast and loose with information that other parts of the government treated much more carefully. As the officer explained to the FBI, \u201cDOS has shown an increased tendency to communicate via email. He believed that they did this for simplicity, to avoid unauthorized disclosures such as [WikiLeaks] and to prevent other USG partners from seeing their \u2018back channel\u2019 discussions. [He] continued to say that the personnel at DOS were experienced and knew that this information was classified. However, they did it anyways and their actions hurt the CIA and other agencies whose [information was] conveyed in the emails.\u201d\n\nThe department\u2019s IT problems\u2014 both the culture of personal email and poor information security that it encouraged\u2014were well known among those who worked with the State Department. One CIA official who reviewed a questionable email in the Clinton investigation told the FBI that the email in question technically \u201cshould be classified, but that he was not surprised that DOS had sent it on an unclassified channel.\u201d\n\nA potentially unlikely CIA executive echoed those same impressions: that the government\u2019s classification system wasn\u2019t necessarily a bright line; sometimes information was technically classified that a reasonable person could argue wasn\u2019t necessary. Mike Morell\u2014the former deputy director of the CIA who started working with former Clinton aide Philippe Reines\u2019 firm Beacon Global Strategies after he retired in 2015\u2014told the FBI after reviewing one email that \u201che understood why the email would be considered classified, but he did not believe that the email would jeopardize any sources, methods, or otherwise compromise national security.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cclassified information\u201d seems like it should be straightforward and binary\u2014it either is or it isn\u2019t\u2014in practice government classification is a tricky and complicated issue. For one thing, different departments can treat the same information differently, as Under Secretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy\u2014a career Foreign Service officer who had started in the top position two years before Hillary Clinton came to the department\u2014explained to the FBI. Whereas the intelligence community often \u201csteals\u201d information, leading it to be classified, the State Department may end up gathering that same information from nonsensitive sources and so never consider it classified; conversations with foreign diplomats may be classified or not\u2014or later upgraded to classified if it\u2019s determined that \u201cthe disclosure of such information might damage national security or diplomatic relationships.\u201d (This was particularly true as governments and leaders shifted around the world.) Plus, the lines around documents and information could shift\u2014many internal or even interagency drafts would be considered unclassified while they were being written, but would then be routinely classified when they were transmitted formally to the National Security Council.\n\nOne State Department official, no fan of Hillary Clinton, said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for her and others to have to communicate sensitive matters via the unclassified email system.\n\nThen, of course, there was the problem of the State Department\u2019s unique mission to engage other countries. As one employee related to the FBI: \u201cGenerally the only way to discuss topics with Foreign Partners is via unclassified channels, or in very sensitive cases, by making arrangements to meet in person at Embassies or at DoS. Since there isn\u2019t a classified system that allows DoS to communicate with its foreign counterparts, conversations that are held with foreign partners in unclassified channels are later \u2018up-classified\u2019 to Secret to protect the information.\u201d\n\nOne State Department official, no fan of Hillary Clinton, said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for her and others to have to communicate sensitive matters via the unclassified email system. \u201cIf you are a professional, you know how to do it and how much to do,\u201d he said. The Department had only three real choices for passing along information: an official cable, a classified email and an unclassified email. \u201cThe process for sending a cable was not quick, nor were executives as likely to get a classified email in a timely manor [sic],\u201d the official said, adding that he \u201ctried to use his best judgment.\u201d The classified emails were generally used primarily for passing \u201clateral information\u201d to other ambassadors, the National Security Council or other parts of the intelligence community. The unclassified email was really the only functional choice \u201cfor day to day interaction,\u201d and while the email system did let users mark a message using a lower-level warning\u2014\u201cSensitive But Unclassified\u201d\u2014it didn\u2019t grant any special protections to such messages.\n\nMany employees, the FBI found, carefully worded emails to \u201ctalk around\u201d classified subjects in unclassified email.\n\nClinton\u2019s close aide Jake Sullivan saw the department\u2019s leaders drowning in information. His own portfolio included managing dozens of employees and simultaneously keeping watch over the globe\u2019s hot spots. He told the FBI his experience was that State Department employees \u201cdid the best they could to make a sound judgment when handling classified information\u201d and they \u201cworked hard while under pressure.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a perfect system\u2014one email with potentially classified information about a foreign military\u2019s activities arrived on his Gmail because he was in Idaho for a bachelor party and didn\u2019t have access to his regular, classified email system\u2014but he said he \u201ccould not recall an instance where anyone expressed a concern with the type of information coming over the unclassified email system.\u201d\n\n***\n\n5. Emailing the president\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t much of an emailer, she did have one coveted Washington email address\u2014President Barack Obama\u2019s. The president\u2019s email system allowed only select addresses to reach him, so when her email address changed, her staff had to notify the White House to add her new email to his approved list of contacts. Clinton said she never received any guidance on how or when to email the president.\n\nThe president, though, was more the exception than the rule in Clinton\u2019s world. She had few correspondents. Just over a dozen individuals\u2014mostly senior advisers and the department\u2019s executive administrative staff\u2014regularly emailed Clinton directly. It was a rare privilege reserved for senior advisers who needed regular contact. Excluding personal correspondence with family and close friends, Abedin, Mills and Sullivan together accounted for 68 percent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s total email traffic as secretary of state. (Clinton also used her device to text staff and send BlackBerry messages.) While \u201cat least a hundred, if not several hundred\u201d State employees had her clintonemail.com address\u2014emails from Hillary often arrived with just an \u201cH\u201d in the \u201cfrom\u201d field\u2014and many of those employees, like Kennedy, were aware she used a personal email account, most didn\u2019t understand she had a private server. Nor was Kennedy aware that the personal email account was her sole one.\n\nIn part, her email flew below the State Department radar both because of her tight circle of correspondents but also because, simply, as one aide said: \u201cClinton was not an email person.\u201d And those who wanted to reach her knew it was better to email her top aides directly, anyway. As the FBI reported, \u201cMultiple State employees advised they considered emailing Abedin, Mills and Sullivan the equivalent of emailing Clinton.\u201d As for what arrived via unclassified email, Sullivan and Abedin both said, repeatedly, that they didn\u2019t question the judgment of people sending that information and relied upon senders to properly mark sensitive information. Sullivan said he would regularly review \u201csituation reports from around the world in an unclassified email.\u201d\n\nRather than do business electronically, Clinton preferred to conduct meetings face-to-face and, as one close aide\u2014a self-described \u201cClintonista\u201d\u2014said, she was a \u201cpaper person,\u201d preferring to read documents in hard copy. While the Presidential Daily Brief\u2014the government\u2019s most valuable document\u2014was often briefed in-person to her at the office, she read voluminously at the office and at home. Since Clinton did not have a classified email account herself, all classified material went to her in hard copy\u2014a process overseen by her executive assistants, Joe McManus and, later, Alice Wells. Clinton, Sullivan recalled, had an \u201cenormous\u201d amount of information, including classified reports, briefed to her in-person or through the paper flow.\n\nFor reading at home, the State Department would also regularly deliver diplomatic pouches full of briefings and reports\u2014the Diplomatic Security agent on duty at each residence would then deliver the pouch to a designated bench to await Clinton\u2019s pickup. (At Whitehaven, the pouches went on a bench outside her bedroom; in Chappaqua, the bench was located near the home\u2019s main entrance.)\n\nAbedin, for her part, found that it was difficult to print from the State Department email system, so she\u2019d often forward emails to her Yahoo email, Clintonmail.com accounts, or even another account that she\u2019d previously used to support the campaign activities of her husband, Anthony Weiner. And there was a lot to print: Clinton didn\u2019t like reading long emails\u2014the BlackBerry font was too small\u2014so she\u2019d often forward such stuff to staff to print. Deluged by tasks and information, Abedin reported that she\u2019d often print and pass along documents to Clinton \u201cwithout reading them.\u201d The FBI also uncovered hundreds of emails sent to one of the Clinton family\u2019s staff on the presidentclinton.com domain requesting that he print emails for her to read. Printing problems dogged Clinton\u2019s team as they traveled the world, too. While special Mobile Communications Teams would outfit hotel rooms overseas with computers hooked up to the State Department network for Abedin or Hanley to use, the FBI found, \u201cit was not uncommon for [aide Monica] Hanley to use her personal Gmail account to print from the mobile DoS unclassified terminal because even though she was using a DoS computer, the DoS connection was unreliable.\u201d\n\nIn June 2010, Clinton received a new device: Just weeks after the first iPad was released, Philippe Reines purchased one for Clinton to use. The iPad, her staff hoped, would give her a way to read news articles on her own. She didn\u2019t like reading news on her BlackBerry, but their hope was short-lived. She initially responded enthusiastically to the idea, responding to Reines\u2019 email that her iPad had arrived by writing, \u201cThat is exciting news\u2014do you think you can teach me to use it on the flight to Kyev next week?\u201d But when the traveling party embarked on the Air Force plane for the meeting with President Viktor Yanukovych, Clinton instead fell asleep with the unopened iPad package in her lap. Reines told the FBI that this struck him as funny because, \u201cin contrast, he would not be able to sleep if he had just received a new iPad.\u201d Then he added a dour note: \u201cThis episode was a foreshadowing for how little she would use the iPad.\u201d Over time, she warmed slightly to the device, using it in the evenings and while traveling for reading news, but once she got comfortable with it, she resisted attempts to upgrade it.\n\nThe next year, when her staff tried to upgrade her to an iPad 2, they had even less success. Abedin emailed Cooper on August 18, 2011, saying simply, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like ipad 2.\u201d Clinton instead gifted the brand new device to Monica Hanley. There was no mistake that Hanley got a hand-me-down: When she logged on for the first time, the device still said \u201cH\u2019s iPad,\u201d so Hanley wiped it clean before using it. As Hanley told the FBI, \u201cIt was not uncommon for Clinton to gift Abedin and Hanley with some of her personal items she no longer wanted.\u201d\n\n***\n\n6. The State Department starts to worry\n\nPagliano\u2019s role in helping run Clinton\u2019s email was well known within the department, at least among its seventh-floor IT staff; he regularly interacted with them to keep Clinton\u2019s email system running smoothly. His knowledge impressed those he interacted with: As one State IT employee said, Pagliano was \u201cvery sharp and technologically savvy individual who likely took action based on the security information and briefings provided.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone at the State Department was pleased with the setup. At some point in the summer of 2009, two State IT specialists summoned Pagliano and asked whether he was aware of the clintonemail.com domain. He said yes. When Pagliano relayed this to one of Clinton\u2019s aides, that person, Pagliano told the FBI, had a \u201c \u2018visceral\u2019 reaction and didn\u2019t want to know any more.\u201d Later in 2009 or early 2010, one of the same State Department employees asked Pagliano again about server, saying it might be a federal records-retention issue and asked him to relay that concern to Clinton\u2019s \u201cinner circle.\u201d Pagliano approached Cheryl Mills in her office and passed along the information. Mills dismissed the worries, saying other former secretaries of state had done the same thing.\n\nJust how far such concerns about Clinton\u2019s email practices went inside the State Department is still a matter of some debate. An inspector general report on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email reported that two IT staff approached the director of S/ES-IRM, John Bentel, and raised concerns about her email use, only to have him tell them it was approved and they should not discuss the server further. (However, in an interview with the FBI, he denies that any such conversation took place. As he told agents, he doesn\u2019t recall saying that, adding that the account \u201cwas inconsistent with his open and welcoming management style.\u201d)\n\nYet rather than appearing to be actively covering up Clinton\u2019s paper trail, Clinton\u2019s staffers\u2014harried as they were and pulled in multiple directions by seemingly daily world crises\u2014seemed simply uninterested in the details of record-keeping, either for Freedom of Information Act purposes or for the Federal Records Act, which governs official papers. Nor did they appear particularly curious even about Clinton\u2019s own email setup. Aides like Mills, Abedin and Sullivan all said that while they knew her email address, they didn\u2019t understand the technology behind it and were \u201cunaware of existence of private server until after Clinton\u2019s tenure.\u201d Mills said she \u201cwas not even sure she knew what a server was at the time\u201d she was Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. It\u2019s not even clear Clinton herself understood her email was running off a homemade computer in her Chappaqua basement: Clinton told the FBI she \u201chad no knowledge of the hardware, software, or security protocols used to construct and operate the servers.\u201d\n\nWhile federal law has strict guidelines about the preservation of public records\u2014both for historical purposes and for FOIA purposes\u2014Mills, who said she received 400 to 700 emails a day, told FBI investigators that she believed that maintaining records was the responsibility of the \u201cfront office,\u201d but she couldn\u2019t say who was responsible for FOIA. Abedin told investigators she \u201calways assumed all of Clinton\u2019s communications, regardless of account, would be subject to FOIA if they contained work-related material,\u201d but the process for that seemed unclear. As Mills saw it, since Clinton was emailing other State Department staff at their official email addresses, her missives were already being tracked. (The State Department\u2019s inspector general later said, this \u201cwas not an appropriate method of preserving record e-mails.\u201d)\n\nJake Sullivan, who told investigators that he\u2019d never been offered nor requested a @clintonemail.com address of his own, reported that his State.gov inbox often ran afoul of size restrictions and he regularly had to \u201carchive\u201d \u201cbig chunks,\u201d but that he \u201ccould not recall any methodology or science he applied when archiving email.\u201d He said he knew about records-retention rules, and so he didn\u2019t delete anything from his State.gov email and he handed over his official papers when he left the State Department, but he also told the FBI he sometimes used Gmail on weekends or while traveling.\n\nBut even the \u201cfront office\u201d at the State Department, to use Mills\u2019 term, didn\u2019t fully comprehend the system for saving electronic records. As the Clinton team arrived at the State Department in 2009, the department was in the process of rolling out a new preservation system that allowed employees to electronically tag emails to preserve a record copy. The system was supposed to be rolled out departmentwide, but S/ES-IRM didn\u2019t actually deploy it to the secure zone of Mahogany Row amid concerns that it would \u201callow overly broad access to sensitive materials.\u201d The Office of the Secretary instead was left with the traditional \u201cprint-and-file\u201d system. So the State Department\u2019s new preservation system never even reached into its top echelons on the seventh floor, a fact that Lewis Lukens\u2014the official who supposedly ran the executive leadership team\u2014told the FBI he didn\u2019t even realize.\n\n***\n\n7. Hackers start sniffing\n\nOn January 9, 2011, Justin Cooper\u2014who shared administrative privileges on the Clinton email server with Pagliano\u2014noticed what he believed was a \u201cbrute force attack\u201d on the server, in which a hacker was overloading the server with attempts to guess a username and password. Cooper, unable in that moment to reach Pagliano, \u201cpanicked,\u201d according to Pagliano, and shut down the server. Cooper told Abedin that someone was trying to \u201chack\u201d the server. Another email later in the day reported he had to reboot the server again as he tried to restore the system and defend against the unsophisticated attack. His concerns lingered, even the next day, he emailed saying, \u201cDon\u2019t email hrc anything sensitive. I can explain more in person.\u201d The attack, though, was ultimately unsuccessful\u2014nor was it particularly difficult to defend against. Pagliano later trained Cooper in the basics of how to respond and block specific Internet addresses that were attacking the site, and he warily told Cooper that he couldn\u2019t be on call to tend the server constantly.\n\nSuch brute force attacks were regular occurrences during the years the server was in operation\u2014but they proved ultimately unsuccessful as far as anyone, including the FBI, could tell. Pagliano could see the attacks unfold as the usernames that intruders attempted to use weren\u2019t anything close to the names of the small handful of real users on the server. He told the FBI that he thought about implementing what was known as \u201ctwo-factor authentication,\u201d which would have required users to enter a special changing code from a digital fob when they logged in, and that he even went so far as install such measures on his own workstation as a test\u2014but ultimately he decided it wasn\u2019t worth the effort. He also never installed what was known as Transport Layer Security, which would have encrypted messages as they passed between the Clinton server and the State Department\u2019s servers, telling the FBI that he figured there wasn\u2019t a need for encryption on a \u201cpersonal\u201d server.\n\nClinton\u2019s email faced other routine security threats. While the CloudJacket monitoring software caught \u201cmultiple instances of potential malicious actors attempting to exploit vulnerabilities,\u201d the \u201cFBI determined none of the activity, however, was successful.\u201d (Similarly, the two iPads used by Clinton that the FBI tested showed no sign of cyber intrusion.) Clinton herself, though, faced multiple phishing or \u201cspear-phishing\u201d attempts, where someone would send a fake email or link hoping to infect her computer with malware or gain access to her email account. Clinton replied to one suspicious email from a regular email correspondent dubiously, \u201cIs this really from you? I was worried about opening it!\u201d Another contained a link to pornographic material. The attempts, though, seemed random and undirected; as Clinton recalled later, she \u201coccasionally received odd looking email, but never noticed an increase in these types of emails that would be a cause for concern.\u201d\n\nYet across the department, email security concerns lingered through that spring of 2011. In February, several State Department employees had their personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts hacked after they responded to a \u201cphishing\u201d email asking them to change their passwords. The hackers, unbeknownst to the employees, then changed the email settings to auto-forward copies of incoming mail to other accounts controlled by the intruders.\n\nThose incidents prompted the department\u2019s security chief, Eric Boswell, to send Clinton a memo on March 11 specifically saying that State emails were being targeted by a hacking threat. He encouraged employees to limit the use of personal email. (Normally, Boswell said later, Clinton was \u201cvery responsive to security issues.\u201d) The next week, there was another attack, ultimately unsuccessful, on the Clinton server, but some in her inner circle didn\u2019t hear about it: Abedin\u2019s email address was misspelled on the note warning of the fresh attack and she never saw the warning.\n\nIn June 2011, Pagliano traveled to Chappaqua to upgrade the server\u2019s technology. He replaced the Seagate external drive, which was beginning to see its disc drive fail with age, with a Cisco device. He added additional memory to the Dell PowerEdge 1950 server, added a Gigabit switch, upgraded the firewall, and added two new security devices: a Cisco botnet filter and a Cisco intrusion prevention service. He also replaced the batteries on the backup power source, updated the BlackBerry server software and installed any necessary patches. Pagliano, who had negotiated to be paid an hourly rate with Cooper for his work on the Clinton servers\u2014Cooper had initially instead offered to pay a regular retainer\u2014was ultimately paid $8,350.83, including expenses for travel and the equipment, for the trip.\n\n***\n\n\n\n8. A wall is breached\n\nIn January 2013, the Clinton server saw what the FBI determined was its only known \u201csuccessful compromise.\u201d According to the FBI\u2019s forensic investigation later, on January 5, the account of a member of Bill Clinton\u2019s staff\u2014who all shared the server with Hillary\u2019s email\u2014was broken into by someone using the anonymizing software Tor. Over the course of the day, three known Tor IP addresses accessed the site and the intruder browsed through the staffer\u2019s email folders and attachments. The FBI said it was \u201cunable to identify the actor(s) responsible,\u201d but that the damage, as far as it could tell, was limited to that lone staffer\u2019s email that one day. And, by the end of the month, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state had ended; after serving out Barack Obama\u2019s first term, she handed in her resignation on February 1, 2013, and returned to private life.\n\nHe told the FBI he only spent 20 minutes on research and guessing before he was able to successfully reset Blumenthal\u2019s password.\n\nSix weeks after she left office, though, another more mundane hack threatened to expose Hillary Clinton\u2019s email address to the world. On March 14, a hacker known as \u201cGuccifer,\u201d a 40-something Romanian taxi driver named Marcel Laz\u0103r Lehel, found in another account he\u2019d cracked an email address belonging to Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton aide and confidant. (The other cracked account was likely the AOL address belonging to Hillary\u2019s predecessor as secretary of state, Colin Powell, whose account Guccifer is known to have hacked around that time.) Guccifer was not a technically sophisticated hacker, relying instead on patience and research to crack users\u2019 passwords and security questions; he later told authorities that he spent six months to get inside the email of a Romanian politician, Corina Cretu. Blumenthal\u2019s email was much easier: He told the FBI he spent only 20 minutes on research and guessing before he was able to successfully reset Blumenthal\u2019s password by answering a security challenge question.\n\nThe account included about 30,000 emails, and Guccifer says he spent seven hours carefully sorting and reviewing the emails, as well as downloading more than two dozen attachments. He took screenshots of various emails, including one email about Benghazi, and noticed that Blumenthal regularly emailed Hillary Clinton. He made a quick attempt to figure out where her server was located but, stymied, gave up. Finally, the next morning, Blumenthal realized he\u2019d been locked out of his account and was able to reset the password again, halting Guccifer\u2019s access.\n\n\u201cGuccifer,\u201d the hacker and a forty-something Romanian taxi driver named Marcel Laz\u0103r Lehel. | YouTube\n\nGuccifer\u2019s modus operandi was to send his findings to the media\u2014earlier that year, he\u2019d cracked the email of members of the Bush family, leaking to the world photos of paintings that George W. Bush was doing in his presidential retirement\u2014and he sent Blumenthal\u2019s emails to dozens of media outlets around the world. The release of Blumenthal\u2019s emails gave the world its first knowledge of Clinton\u2019s clintonemail.com domain name, and by the next day, March 15, Russian and Ukrainian Internet addresses were scanning the Clinton server, unsuccessfully trying to gain access.\n\nThe exposure of the email account encouraged Clinton\u2019s aides to change the secretary of state\u2019s address. Abedin selected [email protected], but the staff feared that they\u2019d lose her existing emails when they changed addresses, so Monica Hanley retrieved an old MacBook laptop from Bill Clinton\u2019s Harlem office and spent several days at her apartment transferring years of Hillary\u2019s emails from the server files into Apple\u2019s Mail program on the laptop. (The hope at the time was that the emails would also be useful in writing her future memoir.)\n\nAnd, by that point, as she considered her post-State Department life and future political plans, the Clinton team was already reconsidering its email setup \u201cdue to user limitations and reliability concerns.\u201d Bryan Pagliano had also moved on professionally, meaning that they couldn\u2019t continue to lean on a close associate for day-to-day help. Staff for both Hillary and Bill Clinton initiated a search to find a vendor to manage the server. Cheryl Mills helped pull together a Request for Proposal outlining the Clintons\u2019 IT needs and three vendors submitted pitches. Pagliano, who was a few months into a new job with the tech research firm Gartner, recommended one of the vendors, a Denver-based company called Platte River Networks.\n\nSo the Clinton email server moved to New Jersey. Over the course of the last 10 days of June, PRN took possession of the server\u2019s equipment and its management. A PRN employee traveled to Chappaqua, removed the existing server hardware and transported it to a secure data center in Secaucus run by a company called Equinix. Beginning on June 30, the Clinton emails were moved from the old server to the new one, migrating the 20 to 30 email accounts associated with presidentclinton.com, wjoffice.com and clintonemail.com one at a time, by right-clicking and dragging each account. The new DATTO backup system took multiple snapshots a day of the server, retaining them for 60 days. Later, at the end of the year, confident in its new setup, PRN of its own volition powered down and disconnected the old Dell servers that the Clintons had used, leaving them to sit unused in the Secaucus data center rack until the FBI took custody of them in the midst of its investigation.\n\nThe Clinton servers were overseen by two PRN employees, one working remotely from home who handled the day-to-day systems administration; another, working at the company\u2019s headquarters in Colorado, who handled hardware installation and \u201chands-on\u201d maintenance. The team continually saw examples of the Clinton team\u2019s relative unsophistication when it came to technology; Mills even occasionally asked PRN for help with her personal account. Such tendencies led them to limit some of the security on the account: The Clinton team had \u201coriginally requested that e-mail on the PRN server be encrypted such that no one but the users could read the content,\u201d but PRN did not do so \u201cto allow systems administrators to troubleshoot problems occurring within user accounts.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, PRN wasn\u2019t always entirely on top of all the technical details itself. It realized in August 2015 that due to \u201ca technical oversight\u201d its Datto backup system, which was supposed to be storing only local copies of the server backup, had also been backing up to Datto\u2019s secure cloud storage\u2014a practice that was promptly discontinued.\n\nIndeed, what comes through time and again in the interview notes of the FBI\u2019s email investigation is\u2014far from a sinister careful coverup to avoid transparency and hide Clinton\u2019s communications\u2014just how disorganized and uncoordinated the technical details of her system actually were. In February 2014, Monica Hanley decided to upload five years\u2019 worth of old Clinton emails to the new PRN server that had been saved to a laptop after Guccifer exposed her address; PRN tried to help Hanley remotely, but when that process failed, Hanley simply Fedexed the laptop to one of the PRN employees at home so he could convert the files and upload them to the server under a new email address, [email protected] The PRN employee completed the task after Googling how to successfully convert the Apple Mail files to the required .pst format using Gmail. No one was able to determine what happened to the MacBook once PRN was finished with it. The same emails may or may not have been saved to an external thumb drive as well, but no one could find it or remembered what happened to it.\n\nAfter the State Department, Clinton went to vendor Platte River Networks to manage the server, and it was relocated to New Jersey. | Getty\n\nMeanwhile the State Department was beginning to ask questions, trying to fill in gaps in its official papers for secretaries of state from Madeline Albright to Colin Powell to Condoleezza Rice to Hillary Clinton, and Congress was asking for documents related to the attacks on Benghazi. When the State Department\u2019s recordkeepers belatedly realized that they\u2019d never saved Clinton\u2019s emails\u2014and realized, simultaneously, that she\u2019d been using a personal outside email account rather than an official one\u2014they asked Clinton\u2019s team to produce her emails. That task fell to her personal lawyer, Heather Samuelson, working with Cheryl Mills.\n\nSamuelson, who worked in the White House liaison office at the State Department, told the FBI that that she had never been part of Clinton\u2019s inner circle; she\u2019d received only two emails from Hillary\u2014one on her birthday one year and another after the death of her grandmother\u2014and didn\u2019t know about the private email system until she became Clinton\u2019s private attorney. Over the course of 2014, she and Mills went back and forth with PRN repeatedly on various exports of the email archives. Samuelson described herself as \u201ctechnically deficient,\u201d and, according to her own statements to the FBI, paid little attention to the technical details of the queries and export of Hillary\u2019s emails when she was gathering files to turn over to the State Department and the House Benghazi Committee, relying on PRN to execute tasks correctly.\n\nSamuelson, Mills, and PRN searched Clinton\u2019s archives for emails used .mil and .gov, as well as the names of members of Congress, foreign leaders and other contacts, as well as keyword searches on terms like \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d \u201cLibya\u201d and \u201cBenghazi.\u201d To assemble the required emails, she used a Lenovo Yoga 2 laptop, but accidentally spilled water on it at one point and, worried that the laptop would fail, she purchased a second Lenovo laptop and copied the email files over to it.\n\nThroughout 2014, Samuelson and Mills struggled to fill in missing gaps in the email queries\u2014many of which seem to have occurred when .gov emails were cc\u2019d\u2014and they made decisions about what to turn over for posterity based only on reading header information, not the body of the emails. They also didn\u2019t have any system for removing duplicates\u2014doing so only if they happened to realize they had duplicate emails.\n\nPRN, at Mills\u2019 instruction, also double-checked that there were no more old emails or server backups lying around on the outdated servers that had been abandoned as part of the switch to PRN\u2019s services. PRN, after traveling to the data center in New Jersey, returned empty-handed, confident that they\u2019d rounded up every Hillary Clinton email they could find.\n\nIn December 2014\u2014the same month that Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin switched email addresses yet again to a new domain, hrcoffice.com\u2014Clinton\u2019s lawyers handed over 55,000 pages of email correspondence to the State Department, totaling about 30,490 separate emails. The State Department\u2019s Office of Information Program and Services picked up 12 banker\u2019s boxes of emails from Clinton\u2019s team. A PRN corporate note from that month about \u201cthe Hilary coverup operation\u201d [sic], the employee told the FBI, was simply a joke.\n\nBut that\u2019s when the questions really began.\n\n***\n\n9. The investigation\n\nAs the State Department team began to review the emails they collected from Hillary Clinton, officials began to raise potentially troubling questions\u2014it appeared that dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of the former secretary\u2019s unclassified emails contained national security secrets.\n\nThe potential scandal burst into public view on March 2, 2015, as the New York Times published a story entitled, \u201cHillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules.\u201d That week, the House Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed her emails. And by July, the FBI was investigating, encouraged by a referral from the inspector general of the intelligence community who saw evidence that Clinton\u2019s odd email setup might have led to the mishandling of classified material.\n\nThe FBI unintentionally demonstrated the confusing and disorganized process behind the Clinton team\u2019s own treatment of the server by managing to recover some 17,448 emails that hadn\u2019t been turned over previously by Clinton\u2019s lawyers. The Pentagon also informed the State Department that it possessed \u201capproximately 1,000 work-related emails\u201d between General David Petraeus and Clinton, most of which were \u201cnot believed\u201d to among those the State Department had in its possession.\n\nAll told, the FBI found 81 email chains, including 193 individual emails, that either were or should have been classified at the time they were sent because, in government parlance, they included \u201cclassified equities\u201d from either the State Department itself or the CIA, FBI, NSA, NGA\u2014the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2014or the Defense Department.\n\nWhile in three of the email chains at least one paragraph was marked with only a (c) for Confidential and contained no additional classification markings, others supposedly contained much more highly sensitive information. According to the FBI\u2019s analysis, conducted in conjunction with other government agencies, eight of Clinton\u2019s email chains should have been Top Secret and 37 were Secret. Seven of the emails, all of which were forwarded to Clinton by Jake Sullivan, were associated with what the government calls a Special Access Program, a highly sensitive project subject to even stricter security precautions. As the FBI investigated, there was no consistent pattern to the supposedly classified emails\u2014some came from career State Department officials, some came from presidential appointees, some from Foreign Service officers and some from other elected officials.\n\nThe FBI provided Clinton with her classified emails, ranging from Confidential to Top Secret/SAP, and \u201cClinton said she did not believe the emails contained classified information.\u201d She said, \u201cIt was often necessary to communicate in code or do the best you could to convey the information considering the email system you were using.\u201d Asked how she would define or decide whether information should be classified, Clinton explained that in her view, \u201cInformation should be classified in the case of covert military action, the use of sensitive sources and where sensitive deliberations took place.\u201d What if its publication would damage national security, the FBI asked? \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is the understanding.\u201d\n\nAll told, \u201cClinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,\u201d the FBI\u2019s report says.\n\nMany of her aides and other State Department employees argued similar points when reviewing the disputed emails. Mills said she didn\u2019t see anything in the seven emails she reviewed that made her concerned that they were written on unclassified systems. Sullivan and Abedin said they relied on senders to properly classify and mark emails. Similarly, Clinton said she \u201cno reason to doubt the judgment of the people working for her on the \u2018front lines.\u2019\u201d\n\nStaff interviewed from the department\u2019s 24-7 Operations Center said they usually sent information in unclassified form in order to quickly disseminate it and elevate it to officials who needed to know but might not be at their desks to receive a classified message. Shown one email about North Korea that reported on a State conference call on July 3, 2009, one operations center official said it was common practice to distribute such summaries on the unclassified system to most quickly reach the most leaders. She said she \u201cbased [the email\u2019s content] on ... her judgment.\u201d Another official, whose name is redacted in the FBI files, reinforced that point, saying he \u201ccould not recall an instance where he was concerned with the Operations Center moving classified information from the high side [classified] to the low side [unclassified].\u201d\n\nAnd, indeed, scattered across the FBI\u2019s investigative files, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that government\u2019s classification system is more complicated than the black-and-white scheme that most outsiders imagine. Clinton herself took issue with one of the \u201cclassified\u201d emails the FBI presented to her in her interview. The email concerned a phone call to Joyce Banda in April 2012\u2014the same week, ironically, that a Tumblr blog in Washington, \u201cTexts from Hillary\u201d was turning a photo of her using her BlackBerry into an internet meme. Banda had assumed the presidency of Malawi after the president of the southeastern African country had died of a massive heart attack. As America\u2019s top diplomat, it fell to Clinton to phone the newly installed head of state. An email from her aide Monica Hanley entitled \u201cCall to President Banda\u201d and cc\u2019ing Abedin, using her private email, [email protected], outlined the background and purpose of the impending phone call with the new leader. Buried within the body of the email sent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s BlackBerry was a paragraph that began with an easy-to-overlook letter in parentheses: (c). In government-speak, the notation meant Confidential, the lowest of the government\u2019s three tiers of classified information. Hillary Clinton told the FBI, though, that she\u2019d never noticed the marking, nor, if she had, would she\u2014three years into her job as head of the State Department\u2014have understood what it meant even if she had noticed it. The \u201cclassified\u201d paragraph in question, after all, appeared straightforward. It read, in its entirety, \u201cPurpose of Call: To offer condolences on the passing of President Mutharika and congratulate President Banda on her recent swearing in.\u201d\n\nThe gray areas of the government\u2019s classification system are also evident in some of the 179 emails Sid Blumenthal sent Secretary Clinton, 24 of which the FBI and the State Department determined contained Confidential information and one of which contained Secret information. Blumenthal, a private citizen with no supposed access to classified material, told investigators that he amassed the knowledge from his own sources, including retired and former members of the U.S. intelligence community, British political advisers, journalists and other friends. The information, which Clinton told the FBI she viewed as \u201cjournalistic\u201d rather than intelligence, wasn\u2019t even always welcomed; sometimes, Clinton told the FBI, she \u201cdid not have the time to read his email.\u201d Blumenthal, Clinton said, \u201cis a prodigious writer whose information was sometimes accurate and sometimes not.\u201d Sullivan explained Blumenthal \u201cliked to help the cause.\u201d (While Clinton was in the Senate, he had often sent Abedin emails to forward to the Clinton, but he realized that Abedin didn\u2019t always pass them along, so he stopped and emailed Hillary directly as secretary of state.)\n\nAdditionally, underscoring the changing lines, about 2,000 of Clinton\u2019s emails were \u201cup-classified\u201d to make them Confidential, and one was \u201cup-classified\u201d to Secret, as the State Department reviewed them in 2015 and 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the seven seemingly most sensitive emails\u2014those regarding SAPs\u2014appear from the FBI\u2019s investigative files to mostly focus on the U.S. drone program, the very existence of which, while widely publicly known and covered in the media, remains technically classified even now. When asked about the emails, Mills was dismissive of security concerns, saying the supposedly highly classified SAP emails were, as she said, \u201cdesigned to inform State officials of media reports concerning the subject matter and that the information in the emails merely confirmed what the public already knew.\u201d Sullivan explained that he felt it was necessary to \u201cdiscu[ss] on unclassified systems due to the operational tempo\u201d at that time, and State employees attempted to talk around classified information.\u201d Sullivan said his colleagues \u201cworked hard while under pressure and used their best judgment to accomplish their mission.\u201d As he explained, in reviewing the emails with the FBI, \u201cState did the best they could to not confirm drone strikes and were as careful as possible, but had to deal with a \u2018rash\u2019 of news reports on drones.\u201d\n\nA CIA official who reviewed some of the emails in question said that \u201che would not have put this information on an unclassified system, but that [he understood why because] the authors were only responding to a media article.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t, though, a universally shared opinion: One ambassador told an FBI agent, after the interview was over and the two were walking toward the elevator, that after viewing the six documents and email chains he\u2019d seen, he understood why people were concerned about the security breach. But ultimately the FBI concluded there was enough gray area\u2014and enough of a lack of criminal intent\u2014that it didn\u2019t appear the actions of Clinton\u2019s team rose to the level of a crime.\n\nPublicly, though, the scandal\u2019s legacy is clearly more muddled. And if a previous Clinton family scandal hinged on what the definition of \u201cis\u201d is, the scandal around the emails appears to hinge on how you view that little (c) on the email about President Banda\u2014as well as the 192 other classified emails identified by the FBI that together represent 0.48 percent of the some 40,000 emails Hillary Clinton sent and received over more than four years as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, all running through a jerry-rigged computer server that let her stay comfortably on the BlackBerry she liked.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the correct percentage of emails Hillary Clinton sent as secretary of state that were identified as classified by the FBI. That percentage is .48 percent, not .0048 percent.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-emails-2016-server-state-department-fbi-214307/"}, "article3": {"title": "Hillary Clinton emails - what's it all about?", "content": "Hillary Clinton emails - what's it all about? Published 6 November 2016\n\nImage source, EPA\n\nHillary Clinton has been cleared for a second time by the FBI over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. What's it all about?\n\nIn July, an FBI investigation concluded no \"reasonable prosecutor\" would bring a criminal case against Mrs Clinton, but that she and her aides were \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information.\n\nThen the FBI surprised everyone, 11 days before the election, by announcing it was examining newly discovered emails sent or received by Hillary Clinton.\n\nTwo days before voting booths opened across the nation, FBI Director James Comey announced he was standing by his original assessment - that Mrs Clinton should not face criminal charges.\n\nSo how did we get here?\n\nWhat's the deal with Hillary Clinton's emails?\n\nShortly before she was sworn in as secretary of state in 2009, Hillary Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York. She then relied on this server, home to the email address hdr22@clintonemail.com, for all her electronic correspondence - both work-related and personal - during her four years in office.\n\nShe also reportedly set up email addresses on the server for her long-time aide, Huma Abedin, and State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills.\n\nShe did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.\n\nMrs Clinton's email system became a national story the first week of March 2015, when the New York Times ran a front-page article on the subject. The article said that the system \"may have violated federal requirements\" and was \"alarming\" to current and former government archive officials.\n\nWhy did she do it?\n\nImage source, Reuters Image caption, The email system was set up initially for former President Bill Clinton, Mrs Clinton said\n\nAccording to Mrs Clinton, the primary reason she set up her own email was for \"convenience\". During a press conference at the UN, she said that she preferred to carry only one smartphone with one email address, rather than have two devices - one for work and one for personal affairs.\n\nAt the time, according to reports, government-issued Blackberry phones were unable to access multiple email accounts.\n\n\"I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way,\" she said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Clinton defended her email use in March 2015\n\nSceptics have countered that the real reason Mrs Clinton established her own email system was because it gave her total control over her correspondence.\n\nWith her email setup, she became the sole arbiter of what should and shouldn't be provided to the government, made public via freedom of information requests or turned over to interested parties, such as the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.\n\nAccording to the State Department inspector general report, in 2010 Mrs Clinton told her deputy chief of staff that one of her concerns with email is that she did not \"want any risk of the personal being accessible\".\n\nAn FBI investigation found that Mrs Clinton used \"numerous personal devices\" while in office and relied on several email servers. Clinton staffers told the FBI that they destroyed some of the replaced devices with a hammer while they could not account for others.\n\nWas this against the law?\n\nImage source, AP\n\nProbably not. Mrs Clinton's email system existed in a grey area of the law - and one that has been changed several times since she left office.\n\nWhen she became secretary of state, the controlling interpretation of the 1950 Federal Records Act was that officials using personal email accounts must ensure that official correspondence is turned over to the government. Ten months after she took office, a new regulation allowed the use of private emails only if federal records were \"preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system\".\n\nMrs Clinton maintains that this requirement was satisfied because most of her emails from her personal account went to, or were forwarded to, people with government accounts, so they were automatically archived. Any other emails were turned over to State Department officials when they issued a request to her - and several of her predecessors - in October 2014.\n\nShe said it is the responsibility of the government employee \"to determine what's personal and what's work-related\" and that she's gone \"above and beyond\" what she was asked to do.\n\nIn November 2014 President Barack Obama signed the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments, which require government officials to forward any official correspondence to the government within 20 days. Even under this new law, however, the penalties are only administrative, not criminal.\n\nThe State Department inspector general report, released in May 2016, found that Mrs Clinton's email system violated government policy and that she did not receive permission prior to instituting it - approval that would not have been granted had she asked. Such transgressions, however, do not constitute criminal conduct.\n\nFBI director James Comey announced the results of a separate FBI investigation on 5 July and concluded that that while \"there is evidence of potential violations\" of criminal statues covering the mishandling of classified information, \"our judgement is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\". It referred the matter to the Justice Department, which closed the case against Mrs Clinton and her aides with no charges.\n\nThe State Department has since resumed its investigation into whether Mrs Clinton or her aides violated government policy in their handling of classified information. If it determines that they did, the punishment could include a formal letter of reprimand or loss of security clearance.\n\nHow many emails are we talking about?\n\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Mrs Clinton said some of her personal emails involved planning her daughter's wedding\n\nAccording to Mrs Clinton, she sent or received 62,320 emails during her time as secretary of state. She, or her lawyers, have determined about half of those - 30,490, roughly 55,000 pages, were official and have been turned over to the State Department.\n\nMrs Clinton said the other emails are private - relating to topics like her daughter's wedding, her mother's funeral and \"yoga routines\".\n\nAt Hillary Clinton's request, the State Department released the first set of emails sent on her private account in May 2015, with many relating to the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.\n\nIn early August 2015, she signed an affidavit swearing she had turned over all copies of government records from her time in office.\n\nThe FBI found \"several thousand\" work-related emails that were not turned over to the State Department, although it concluded that the emails were deleted prior to 2014 and were not intentionally removed \"in an effort to conceal them\".\n\nAbout 3,000 emails are expected to be released in the run-up to election day, but many more will not be processed until after 8 November.\n\nHave other politicians engaged in similar activities?\n\nMrs Clinton is far from alone. Other politicians and officials - both in federal and state governments - sometimes have relied on personal email for official business. Colin Powell, secretary of state under President George W Bush, told ABC he used a personal email account while in office, including to correspond with foreign leaders.\n\nThe State Department inspector general report found that many of Mrs Clinton's predecessors - including Mr Powell - were also not in compliance with federal recordkeeping requirements, although the rules governing their actions were less detailed when they were in office.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Powell had once advised Mrs Clinton at a dinner party to use private email, although not while handling classified information. But he later denied he had ever done such a thing.\n\nOutside of Washington, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush - a 2016 candidate for the US presidency - relied on a private email address (jeb@jeb.org). Like Mrs Clinton, he has selected which correspondence to make public.\n\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Colin Powell used a personal email account while Secretary of State\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker, another former Republican presidential aspirant, faced questions over his staff's use of private email addresses when he was Milwaukee County executive.\n\nGovernment Executive magazine conducted a poll in February 2015 of 412 high-level federal workers and found that 33% of those surveyed said they use personal email for government business \"at least sometimes\".\n\nMrs Clinton differs from these examples not in manner but in extent - because she used her personal email address exclusively. And, unlike Mr Bush and Mr Walker, her actions were governed by federal law.\n\nSo why is this a controversy?\n\nImage source, Getty Images\n\nThis became a big deal in large part because Mrs Clinton is asking the US public to trust that she is complying with both the \"letter and the spirit of the rules\", in the words of her spokesperson, Nick Merrill.\n\nThe New York Times story was prompted by information provided to the paper by the congressional Benghazi committee, and conservative critics allege that there is no way to prove that she is being forthcoming in providing their investigation with all the relevant material.\n\nHer \"convenience\" explanation has been difficult for some to swallow, given that as secretary of state she travelled with an extensive entourage capable of carrying her additional phone. And in February 2015, she told a television interviewer that she now carries multiple devices - an iPhone and a Blackberry, as well as an iPad and an iPad mini.\n\nIn addition, critics on both the left and the right have expressed concern that her reliance on a \"homebrew\" email system made her communications more susceptible to hackers and foreign intelligence services.\n\nExactly how secure was her email?\n\nImage source, AP Image caption, The server may have been located in the Clintons' home in New York state\n\nDuring her press conference, Mrs Clinton said that that there \"were no security breaches\" of her server and that robust protections put in place \"proved to be effective and secure\".\n\nIndependent cybersecurity analysts have said that expert hackers can break into email servers without leaving any evidence, however. And commercially available security systems are no match for government-protected systems - but even those aren't invulnerable, as a November 2014 intrusion into the State Department's email system proved.\n\nShe has repeatedly said that no classified material was transmitted via her email account and that she sent only one email to a foreign official - in the UK.\n\nBut in July 2015, the inspector general of the US intelligence community, Charles McCullough, told Congress she had sent at least four messages that contained information derived from classified material. A month later, Mr McCullough revealed that two of the emails contained information deemed \"top secret\" - the highest classification level.\n\nResponding to building pressure, Mrs Clinton finally agreed in August 2015 to hand over the private server she used for a preliminary FBI investigation into the security of classified information contained among her emails.\n\nShe also said she would hand over memory sticks containing copies of the emails.\n\nBy the time the final batch of Clinton emails were released in March 2016, the total number of emails receiving an after-the-fact classified designation had surpassed 2,000.\n\nIn May 2016 the Romanian hacker Guccifer, in US prison on felony hacking charges, told Fox News that he had successfully accessed Mrs Clinton's email server several times - an assertion the Clinton campaign denies and the State Department and prosecutors said there is no evidence to support.\n\nThe July 2016 FBI report found no \"direct evidence\" of unauthorised access to her email servers, according to James Comey, but that the lack of robust security meant that \"it is possible that hostile actors gained access\".\n\nWait, the State Department was hacked?\n\nImage source, White House Image caption, President Barack Obama emailed Mrs Clinton at her private address, the White House has said\n\nIndeed, it was. According to sources cited by CNN, the November 2014 attack was the \"worst ever\" cyberattack on a government agency , requiring department IT workers to shut down its entire unclassified email system for a weekend.\n\nThe US government suspects Russian hackers were behind the attack - and were also responsible for similar efforts against the White House, postal service and other agencies.\n\nAlthough Mrs Clinton wasn't affected by that particular incident, some of her personal correspondence was revealed in March 2013 when a confidante, Sidney Blumenthal, had his aol.com address compromised by the hacker named Guccifer (later revealed to be a Romanian named Marcel-Lehel Lazar).\n\nAlthough Guccifer only exposed emails Mr Blumenthal sent to Mrs Clinton, not her replies, it did reveal the secretary of state's private email address two years before the New York Times made it a national story.\n\nWhat about the new twist?\n\nThe FBI announced at the end of October that it had discovered new emails \"in connection with an unrelated case... that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\".\n\nDirector James Comey said investigators would determine whether the emails contain classified information.\n\nIt emerged that the newly discovered emails were being examined as part of an FBI investigation into disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31806907"}}
