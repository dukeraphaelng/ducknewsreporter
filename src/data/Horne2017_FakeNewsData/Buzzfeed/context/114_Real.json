In a photo op before the meeting, Trump said this to Putin in reference to the assembled press: \u201cGet rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have this problem in Russia but we do.\u201d Responded Putin: \u201cWe also have. It\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nAh ha ha ha ha. Actually not. At all. Because Putin\u2019s government has a long history of cracking down on journalists who aren\u2019t willing to toe Putin\u2019s preferred line on, well, everything. Investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested last month on drug charges \u2013 which he insists were made up \u2013 after a series of reports detailing corruption within Russian government. (An ambulance doctor who examined Golunov said that the reporter had a concussion, bruising and possible broken ribs.) Last April, investigative reporter Maxim Borodin died after falling from his fifth story apartment. (Russian officials did not pursue a criminal inquiry of Borodin\u2019s death.)\n\n\u201cRussia has a record of brushing aside suspicious deaths of members of the press,\u201d said Nina Ognianova, a program coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists, at the time. \u201cWe urge authorities on both the regional and federal level to consider that Borodin may have been attacked and that his investigative journalism was the motive.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments to Putin \u2013 \u201cyou don\u2019t have this problem in Russia\u201d \u2013 seem to overlook the violence with which Russia deals with reporters who don\u2019t write what the government wants. And this is far from the only time that Trump has praised the power (and methods of retaining that power) of rogue dictators and authoritarian rulers. FAR from it.\n\nConsider this:\n\nTrump on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\n\n* \u201cWell, first of all, let me say that I think that Kim Jong Un, or Chairman Kim, as some people say, is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. I think he\u2019s very much \u2013 I talk to him a lot about it, and he\u2019s very much into the fact that \u2013 he believes, like I do, that North Korea has tremendous economic potential like perhaps few other developing nations anywhere in the world.\u201d (May 27, 2019)\n\n* \u201cKim Jong Un has been, really, somebody that I\u2019ve gotten to know very well and respect, and hopefully \u2013 and I really believe that, over a period of time, a lot of tremendous things will happen.\u201d (April 11, 2019)\n\n*[Kim] wrote me beautiful letters and they\u2019re great letters. We fell in love.\u201d (September 29, 2018)\n\n* \u201cChairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly. And I think he wants to see something happen. So we have done \u2013 I think, mutually, we\u2019ve done very well with respect to North Korea.\u201d (September 24, 2018)\n\nTrump on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\n\n* \u201cPresident Erdogan. He\u2019s tough, but I get along with him. And maybe that\u2019s a bad thing, but I think it\u2019s a really good thing.\u201d (June 29, 2019)\n\n* \u201cWell, thank you very much. It\u2019s my honor to be with a friend of mine, somebody I\u2019ve become very close to, in many respects, and he\u2019s doing a very good job: the President of Turkey.\u201d (June 29, 2019)\n\n* \u201cThank you very much. It\u2019s a great honor and privilege \u2013 because he\u2019s become a friend of mine \u2013 to introduce President Erdogan of Turkey. He\u2019s running a very difficult part of the world. He\u2019s involved very, very strongly and, frankly, he\u2019s getting very high marks.\u201d (September 21, 2017)\n\nTrump on Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\n* \u201cAnd I like President Xi a lot. I consider him a friend, and \u2013 but I like him a lot. I\u2019ve gotten to know him very well. He\u2019s a strong gentleman, right? Anybody that \u2013 he\u2019s a strong guy, tough guy.\u201d (June 30, 2019)\n\n* \u201cPresident Xi, who is a strong man, I call him King, he said, \u2018But I am not King, I am president.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, you\u2019re president for life and therefore, you\u2019re King.\u2019 He said, \u2018Huh. Huh.\u2019 He liked that.\u201d (April 2, 2019)\n\n* \u201cI had President Xi, who\u2019s a friend of mine, who\u2019s a very, very good man.\u201d (April 12, 2018)\n\nTrump on Russian President Vladimir Putin\n\n* \u201cHad a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia. As I have always said, long before the Witch Hunt started, getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing\u2026.\u201d (May 3, 2019)\n\n* \u201cSo many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!\u201d (July 18, 2018)\n\n* \u201cI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing\u2026\u201d (March 21, 2018)\n\n* \u201cThe man has very strong control over a country,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a very different system and I don\u2019t happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he\u2019s been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.\u201d (September 7, 2016)\n\n* \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!\u201d (December 20, 2016)\n\nThat\u2019s not a comprehensive list \u2013 by any means. But you get the idea. Trump\u2019s admiration for and praise of authoritarian rulers \u2013 and the means by which they maintain their power \u2013 is a feature not a glitch of this President and his presidency. When you combine the fights he\u2019s picked with traditional US allies (Australia, Germany etc.), you begin to grasp where Trump\u2019s mind is when it comes to the preferred way to lead people. And that\u2019s scary.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/donald-trump-dictators-kim-jong-un-vladimir-putin/index.html"}, "article2": {"title": "In Context: Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018very fine people on both sides\u2019 remarks (transcript)", "content": "On Aug. 15, 2017, President Donald Trump held a press conference to discuss an executive order he had signed on infrastructure permitting. Reporters shortly began asking questions about Trump\u2019s initial response to violent protests in Charlottesville, Va. It was at this press conference that Trump said that \"you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\nOn April 25, 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden declared his 2020 candidacy for the Democratic nomination and the presidency by recalling the events in Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s comments. \"With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,\" Biden said.\n\nThe next day, Trump responded, saying \"If you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly. And I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals.\" Trump also said he would defeat Biden \"very easily.\"\n\nWe wanted to look at Trump\u2019s comments in their original context. Here is a transcript of the questions Trump answered that addressed the Charlottesville controversy in the days after it happened. (His specific remarks about \"very fine people, on both sides\" come in the final third of the transcript.)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nReporter: \"Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis?\"\n\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t wait long. I didn\u2019t wait long.\"\n\nReporter: \"Forty-eight hours.\"\n\nTrump: \"I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct -- not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don\u2019t make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don\u2019t know the facts. And it\u2019s a very, very important process to me, and it\u2019s a very important statement.\n\n\"So I don\u2019t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to --\n\nReporter: \"So you had to (inaudible) white supremacists?\"\n\nTrump: \"I brought it. I brought it. I brought it.\"\n\nReporter: \"Was it terrorism, in your opinion, what happened?\"\n\nTrump: \"As I said on -- remember, Saturday -- we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America. And then it went on from there. Now, here\u2019s the thing --\"\n\nReporter: (Inaudible)\n\nTrump: \"Excuse me. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here\u2019s the thing: When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn\u2019t even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened.\n\n\"Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don\u2019t want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear was a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC -- her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine -- really, actually, an incredible young woman. But her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said.\n\n\"And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you, and unlike -- excuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.\"\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nReporter: \"The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you?\"\n\nTrump: \"Not at all. I think the country -- look, you take a look. I\u2019ve created over a million jobs since I\u2019m President. The country is booming. The stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country. We\u2019re doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So the head of Walmart, who I know -- who\u2019s a very nice guy -- was making a political statement. I mean -- I\u2019d do it the same way. And you know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct. And there was no way -- there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters. Unlike a lot of reporters --\n\nReporter: \"Nazis were there.\"\n\nReporter: \"David Duke was there.\"\n\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well stated. In fact, everybody said, \u2018His statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t have made it sooner because I didn\u2019t know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don\u2019t know all of the facts.\n\n\"It was very important -- excuse me, excuse me -- it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement -- and the first statement was made without knowing much, other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after, with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things -- excuse me -- there are still things that people don\u2019t know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts.\"\n\nReporter: \"Two questions. Was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you\u2019re feeling about your chief strategist, Stephen Bannon?\"\n\nTrump: \"Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country. And that is -- you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That\u2019s what I\u2019d call it. Because there is a question: Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nReporter: \"Can you tell us broadly what your -- do you still have confidence in Steve?\"\n\nTrump: \"Well, we\u2019ll see. Look, look -- I like Mr. Bannon. He\u2019s a friend of mine. But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him, he\u2019s a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He\u2019s a good person. He actually gets very unfair press in that regard. But we\u2019ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. But he\u2019s a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.\"\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nReporter: \"Sen. (John) McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.\"\n\nTrump: \"Well, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sure Senator McCain must know what he\u2019s talking about. But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead.\"\n\nReporter: \"Well, I\u2019m saying, as Senator --\"\n\nTrump: \"No, define it for me. Come on, let\u2019s go. Define it for me.\"\n\nReporter: \"Senator McCain defined them as the same group --\"\n\nTrump: \"Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at -- excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\n\n\"Let me ask you this: What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Wait a minute. I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019m not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day --\n\n\" I will tell you something. I watched those very closely -- much more closely than you people watched it. And you have -- you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I\u2019ll say it right now. You had a group -- you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.\"\n\nReporter: \"Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?\"\n\nTrump: \"Those people -- all of those people \u2013 excuse me, I\u2019ve condemned neo-Nazis. I\u2019ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\"\n\nReporter: \"Should that statue be taken down?\"\n\nTrump: \"Excuse me. If you take a look at some of the groups, and you see -- and you\u2019d know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you\u2019re not -- but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\n\n\"So this week it\u2019s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\n\n\"But they were there to protest -- excuse me, if you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead.\"\n\nReporter: \"Should the statues of Robert E. Lee stay up?\"\n\nTrump: \"I would say that\u2019s up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located.\"\n\nReporter: \"How concerned are you about race relations in America? And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office?\"\n\nTrump: \"I think they\u2019ve gotten better or the same. Look, they\u2019ve been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that, because he\u2019d make speeches about it. But I believe that the fact that I brought in -- it will be soon -- millions of jobs -- you see where companies are moving back into our country -- I think that\u2019s going to have a tremendous, positive impact on race relations.\n\n\"We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country. I think that\u2019s going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It\u2019s jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay, and when they have that, you watch how race relations will be.\n\n\"And I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We\u2019re fixing the inner cities. We\u2019re doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It\u2019s a priority for me, and it\u2019s very important.\"\n\nReporter: \"Mr. President, are you putting what you\u2019re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane?\"\n\nTrump: \"I\u2019m not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I\u2019m saying is this: You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs -- and it was vicious and it was horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch.\n\n\"But there is another side. There was a group on this side. You can call them the left -- you just called them the left -- that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that\u2019s the way it is.\n\nReporter: (Inaudible) \"\u2026 both sides, sir. You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are the --\"\n\nTrump: \"Yes, I think there\u2019s blame on both sides. If you look at both sides -- I think there\u2019s blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don\u2019t have any doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say.\"\n\nReporter: \"The neo-Nazis started this. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest --\"\n\nTrump: \"Excuse me, excuse me. They didn\u2019t put themselves -- and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.\"\n\nReporter: \"George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.\"\n\nTrump: \"George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?\"\n\nReporter: \"I do love Thomas Jefferson.\"\n\nTrump: \"Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue?\n\n\"So you know what, it\u2019s fine. You\u2019re changing history. You\u2019re changing culture. And you had people -- and I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\n\n\"Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group.\"\n\nReporter: \"Sir, I just didn\u2019t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? I just don\u2019t understand what you were saying.\"\n\nTrump: \"No, no. There were people in that rally -- and I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I\u2019m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.\n\n\"But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because, I don\u2019t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn\u2019t have a permit. So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country -- a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country.\n\n\"Does anybody have a final --\n\nReporter: \"What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn\u2019t get health care --\n\nTrump: \"Well, you know, I\u2019ll tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You\u2019ll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we\u2019ll get the infrastructure. And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we\u2019ll have bipartisan support on. I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure.\"\n\nReporter: \"Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?\"\n\nTrump: \"No, I\u2019ll be reaching out. I\u2019ll be reaching out.\"\n\nReporter: \"When will you be reaching out?\"\n\nTrump: \"I thought that the statement put out -- the mother\u2019s statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I will tell you, it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And, really, under the kind of stress that she\u2019s under and the heartache that she\u2019s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something. I won\u2019t forget it.\n\n\"Thank you, all, very much. Thank you. Thank you.\"", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/"}, "article3": {"title": "Trump's Boy Scouts Speech And The Thin Line Between Openness And Recklessness", "content": "Trump's Boy Scouts Speech And The Thin Line Between Openness And Recklessness\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\n\"Know your audience\" is usually the first rule of public speaking. But that doesn't really seem to matter all that much to President Trump.\n\nTrump became overtly political in yet another setting that some are seeing as crossing the line \u2014 in a speech to the Boy Scouts.\n\nIronically, Trump began his remarks Monday night promising not to talk about politics.\n\n\"Tonight, we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C., you've been hearing about with the fake news and all of that,\" Trump said at the Boy Scouts National Jamboree in West Virginia. \"We're going to put that aside. And instead we're going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young Scouts can achieve your dreams, what to think of, what I've been thinking about. You want to achieve your dreams, I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? Right?\"\n\nApart from using \"hell\" in front of an audience of thousands of minors, Trump did not stick to that promise. His speech quickly became political.\n\n\"You know, I go to Washington,\" Trump said, \"and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp, and it's not a good place. In fact, today, I said we ought to change it from the word 'swamp' to the word 'cesspool' or perhaps to the word 'sewer.' \"\n\nNot exactly the message of how to affect constructive change through politics. Trump was just getting warmed up.\n\nHe shouted out to some of the members of his administration who were former Scouts, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was a past president of Boy Scouts of America and was honored at the event with a bronze statue; Vice President Pence; Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke; Energy Secretary Rick Perry; and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.\n\nPrice's name triggered something for Trump.\n\n\"Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services,\" Trump began. And then: \"And he's doing a great job. And hopefully he's going to get the votes [Tuesday] to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that's really hurting us.\"\n\nTrump's injection of Price getting health care votes was odd not just because Trump pledged not to talk politics, but also because Price is a member of Trump's Cabinet with no control over Senate votes. He wasn't even a senator; he was a member of the House, so while he has contacts in Congress, his strongest relationships are on the other side of the Capitol.\n\nTrump wasn't done with Price. \"By the way, are you going to get the votes?\" Trump asked, looking at Price. \"He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better. Otherwise I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired.' I'll get somebody.\"\n\nTrump looked like he was joking. Right, Secretary Price? Right. Ha-ha. Hee-hee. Hoo-hoo.\n\n\"He better get Sen. [Shelley Moore] Capito to vote for it,\" Trump noted of the senator from West Virginia, who has been undecided even about the motion to proceed to debate on health care. \"He better get the other senators to vote for it. It's time. You know, after seven years of saying 'repeal and replace Obamacare,' we have a chance to now do it. They better do it. Hopefully they'll do it.\"\n\nTrump has been on fire of late when it comes to rattling the people who work for him. After shaking up his White House on Friday \u2014 bringing in a new communications director in New York hedge-fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, followed by the prompt resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 Trump has been publicly shaming his attorney general, Jeff Sessions.\n\nTrump called Sessions \"beleaguered\" on Monday and then whacked him again on Twitter on Tuesday, criticizing him for not going after 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, and for leaks in the intelligence community. Ignore the fact that once Trump won the presidency, he said he didn't think it was a good idea to try to prosecute Clinton.\n\nSuffice it to say, Sessions, an Eagle Scout member of Trump's Cabinet, was not on hand.\n\nTrump took an oblique shot at Republicans in Congress, too: \"As the Scout law says, a Scout is trustworthy, loyal \u2014 we could use some more loyalty, I will tell that you that.\"\n\nThe crowd's chanting seemed to egg him on. He took a familiar campaign shot at the media.\n\n\"By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible massive crowd, record-setting, is going to be shown on television tonight?\" Trump said. \"One percent or zero? The fake media will say, 'President Trump spoke' \u2014 you know what is \u2013 'President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today.' That's some \u2014 that is some crowd. Fake media. Fake news.\"\n\nHe was really rolling at that point, but it should be noted this was not a campaign rally, though Trump began to treat it like one. It had a familiar feeling and seemed to provide the adulation that fuels him.\n\nThe Boy Scouts pointed out that the organization is \"nonpartisan\" and that this was a \"long-standing tradition\" to invite presidents to their jamboree. Trump is the eighth to attend.\n\n\"By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a Jamboree?\" Trump said looking around with his arms stretched out wide. \"And we'll be back. We'll be back. The answer is no. But we'll be back.\"\n\nIt's true that Obama never attended in person, but he did record a video message in 2010. And while Trump wants to show his affinity with the Scouts, he wasn't one. Obama, on the other hand, was.\n\nTrump's use of \"hell\" was not the only utterance that could be seen as inappropriate by parents of the assembled Scouts. The president of the United States, in front of adolescent boys, went on to allude to a sordid story of the way a rich friend, William Levitt of Levittown fame (or infamy), lived his life after making his money.\n\n\"Sold his company for a tremendous amount of money,\" Trump said. \"And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. I won't go any more than that, because you're Boy Scouts, so I'm not going to tell you what he did. Should I tell you? Should I tell you? You're Boy Scouts, but you know life. You know life.\"\n\nTrump seemed to realize that as much as he wanted to tell the story, his \"locker room talk\" might not be appropriate. For as much as he wanted to mock the media and say the cameras weren't turned on, he knew they were. He knew every word he said was being recorded and on camera with thousands of witnesses.\n\nSome of the boys howled, as boys do, but some of their parents didn't seem too pleased, based on the comments on the Boy Scouts of America's Facebook page.\n\nTrump then meandered back to try for an inspirational moment: \"So as much as you can do something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you're going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.\"\n\nBut then he veered off course again to talk about himself:\n\n\"Now, with that, I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up since the election, Nov. 8 \u2014 do we remember that day? Was that a beautiful day? What a day. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, these dishonest people, where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. They forgot about the forgotten people.\"\n\nAnd then he launched into a long, meandering riff about his Electoral College win:\n\n\"And you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. Popular vote is much easier. We have \u2014 because New York, California, Illinois, you have to practically run the East Coast. And we did. We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Pennsylvania. We won and won. So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. You know I went to Maine four times because it's one vote, and we won. We won. One vote. I went there because I kept hearing we're at 269. But then Wisconsin came in. Many, many years. Michigan came in. So \u2014 and we worked hard there. \"You know, my opponent didn't work hard there, because she was told ... she was told she was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. The car industry is moving to Mexico. Why is she going to move \u2014 she's there. Why are they allowing it to move? And by the way, do you see those car industry \u2014 do you see what's happening? They're coming back to Michigan. They're coming back to Ohio. They're starting to peel back in. \"And we go to Wisconsin, now, Wisconsin hadn't been won in many, many years by a Republican. But we go to Wisconsin, and we had tremendous crowds. And I'd leave these massive crowds, I'd say, why are we going to lose this state? The polls, that's also fake news. They're fake polls. But the polls are saying \u2014 but we won Wisconsin.\"\n\nThere was even more \u2014 he went on about the latest jobs report, how people will be saying \"Merry Christmas\" again and the \"billions and billions and billions\" more money he's going to be pouring into the military.\n\nThis wasn't the first time he has talked about politics in a setting where that could be seen as inappropriate. Remember that speech in front of the CIA memorial wall in which he asserted that most of the people in the room probably voted for him?\n\nIt won't be the last time, either.\n\nThis president couldn't care less about political and societal norms. But let's be very clear \u2014 none of this is normal. Trump has been publicly shaming his attorney general, mocking special counsel and congressional investigations, and confirming the existence of what was previously a covert CIA program \u2014 and that was all just Tuesday, and he did it on Twitter.\n\nTrump has no filter. It's giving Americans a window into his mind, but there is a thin line between openness and recklessness.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/07/25/539241800/trump-s-boy-scouts-speech-and-the-thin-line-between-openness-and-recklessness"}}
