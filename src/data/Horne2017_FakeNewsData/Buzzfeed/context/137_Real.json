The recording of Trump talking on a bus to then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush was published earlier on Friday by The Washington Post, threatening to derail Trump\u2019s campaign just two days before the second presidential debate.\n\nIn the recording, Trump talked in lewd terms about his attempt to seduce a married woman. \u201cI did try and f**k her. She was married,\u201d Trump said. Trump added that he \u201cmoved on her like a bitch, but I couldn\u2019t get there.\u201d\n\nAt another point in the recording, which was made as Trump and Bush spoke off-camera on a bus, Trump boasted about kissing and groping women. \u201cI just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d\n\nTrump added that he thought his celebrity status allowed him to act this way. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do anything.\u201d\n\nLater Friday night, Trump issued a statement in a minute-long video released on Facebook. \u201cI said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,\u201d he said, and called the video \u201ca distraction from the important issues we\u2019re facing today. We are losing ourjobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago, and Washington is totally broken.\u201d He went on to accuse Bill Clinton of abusing women and Hillary Clinton of having \u201cbullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re tracking comments from Trump\u2019s supporters, detractors and primary rivals as they pour in through emails and across social media. While many Republican commenters seem to agree with Michael Gerson\u2019s assessment that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cpredatory,\u201d and \u201cdemeaning,\u201d there was no immediate sign on Friday of a broader shift in voting loyalty away from the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nTEAM TRUMP\n\nDonald Trump, Republican presidential nominee\n\nResponse: \u201cThis was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course \u2013 not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.\u201d\n\nAnd later Friday night: \u201cI\u2019ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.\u201d Watch the full video here.\n\nGov. Mike Pence, Republican vice presidential nominee\n\nResponse: \u201cAs a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.\u201d\n\nMelania Trump, wife of Donald Trump\n\nResponse: \u201cThe words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. \u201d\n\nTexas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Trump\u2019s Texas campaign chairman\n\nResponse: \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse to ever talk about women in such a crude and demeaning way. He was certainly right to apologize. But we can\u2019t let this firestorm distract voters from the frightening policies revealed today in the WikiLeaks of Hillary\u2019s emails, including her \u201cdream\u201d of \u201copen trade and open borders,\u201d which would spell ruin for the future of our country.\u201d\n\nBen Carson\n\nResponse: \u201cIn no way do I condone Trumps behavior \u2013 in fact I condemn any form of disrespect toward women. We should always honor and respect the dignity of our mothers, sisters and daughters. Even though the incident happened ten years ago, well before Trump entered the political arean, this behavior is unacceptable, especially by someone who aspires to higher office \u2026 I feel fairly certain that the progressives have had knowledge of this conversation for a long time and dropped it at this point in time in an effort too [sic] obscure the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton and her desire for open borders.\u201d\n\nGOP LEADERSHIP\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R, Wisconsin\n\nResponse: \u201cI am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow\u2019s event in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R, Ky.\n\nResponse: \u201cThese comments are repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance. As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nReince Priebus, RNC Chairman\n\nResponse: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nSen. John Thune, R, South Dakota\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.\u201d\n\nCURRENT GOP SENATORS/REPS/GOVS\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, R, New Hampshire\n\nResponse: \u201cI wanted to be able to support my party\u2019s nominee, chosen by the people, because I feel strongly that we need a change in direction for our country. However, I am a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women. I will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead will be writing in Governor Pence for president on Election Day.\u201d\n\nRep. Bradley Byrne, R, AL\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s comments regarding women were disgraceful and appalling. There are absolutely no circumstances under which it would ever be appropriate to speak of women in such a way.It is now clear Donald Trump is not fit to be President of the United States and cannot defeat Hillary Clinton. I believe he should step aside and allow Governor Pence to lead the Republican ticket.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, R, Utah\n\nResponse: \u201cI\u2019m out. I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nRep. Mike Coffman, R, Colorado\n\nResponse: \u201cFor the good of the country, and to give the Republicans a chance of defeating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump should step aside. His defeat at this point seems almost certain. And four years of Hillary Clinton is not what is best for this country. Mr. Trump should put the country first and do the right thing.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike Crapo, R, Idaho\n\nResponse: I have reached the decision that I can no longer endorse Donald Trump. This is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his patter of behavior has left me with no choice. His repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning. I have spent more than two decades working on domestic violence prevention. Trump\u2019s most recent excuse of \u201clocker room talk\u201d is completely unacceptable and is inconsistent with protecting women from abusive, disparaging treatment.\n\nSen. Deb Fischer, R, Nebraska\n\nResponse: \u201cThe comments made by Mr. Trump were disgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance.\u201d + \u201cIt would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nMike Gallagher, R, candidate for Congress in Wisconsin\u2019s 8th District\n\nResponse: \u201cI denounce Donald Trump\u2019s disgusting and offensive comments and strongly echo the sentiments of my mother, sister, niece and all women who deserve to be treated with our utmost respect.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R, Colorado\n\nResponse: \u201cI cannot and will not support someone who brags about degrading and assaulting women. I am committed to defeating Hillary Clinton. The only way this is now possible is with a new nominee that reflect the values of our country and our party. I will not vote for Donald Trump. If Donald Trump wishes to defeat Hillary Clinton, he should do the only thing that will allow us to do so \u2013 step aide, and allow Mike Pence to be the Republican party\u2019s nominee. If he fails to do so, I will not vote for Hillary Clinton but will instead write-in my vote for Mike Pence.\u201d\n\nGov. Bill Haslam, R, Tennesse\n\nResponse: \u201cIt is time for the good of the nation and the Republican Party for Donald Trump to step aside and let Gov. Mike Pence assume the role as the party\u2019s nominee. If he does not step aside, I will write in a Republican for the office of President.\u201d\n\nRep. Joe Heck, R, Nev. (Candidate for U.S. Senate)\n\nResponse: \u201cI condemn in the strongest terms possible terms Donald Trump\u2019s comments. The language he used was disgraceful and there are no circumstances where such behavior is acceptable.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nGov. Gary Herbert, R, Utah\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statements are beyond offensive & despicable. While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump. #utpol\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R, Wisconsin\n\nResponse: Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments are completely indefensible and I refuse to even attempt to try and do so.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nSen. Mark Kirk, R, Illinois\n\nResponse: \u201cDJT is a malignant clown \u2013 unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States.\u201d + \u201c.@realDonaldTrump should drop out. @GOP should engage rules for emergency replacement.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nRep. Mia Love, R, Utah\n\nResponse: For the past several months I have been one of the few who refused to endorse Donald Trump. \u2026 Mr. Trump has yet to clear that bar and his behavior and bravado have reached a new low. I cannot vote for him. For the good of the party, and the country, he should step aside.\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nSen. John McCain, R, Arizona\n\nResponse: \u201cThere are no excuses for Donald Trump\u2019s offensive and demeaning comments. No woman should ever be victimized by this kind of inappropriate behavior. He alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R, Alaska\n\nResponse: \u201cI cannot and will not support Donald Trump for president. He has forfeited the right to be our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R, Alaska\n\nResponse: \u201cI\u2019m calling on Trump to step aside for Gov. Pence. Trump can\u2019t lead on critical issue of ending [domestic] violence & sexual assault.\u201d\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, R, Penn.\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s comments were outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nFORMER RIVALS\n\nFmr. Gov. Jeb Bush, R, Florida\n\nResponse: \u201cAs the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R, Texas\n\nResponse: \u201cThese comments are disturbing and inappropriate, there is simply no excuse for them.\u201d + \u201cEvery wife, mother, daughter \u2014 every person \u2014 deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald Trump does not represent me and my party. I understand the responsibility of Republicans to support their nominee. Our nominee has weighty responsibilities as well. Donald Trump has manifestly failed in these responsibilities. \u2026 Today I ask Donald Trump to step aside and for the RNC to replace him with Gov. Mike Pence.\u201d\n\nGov. John Kasich, R, Ohio\n\nResponse: \u201cNothing that has happened in the last 48 hours is surprising to me or many others. Many people were angry and questioned why I would not endorse Donald Trump or attend the Republican Convention. I\u2019ve long had concerns with Donald Trump that go beyond his temperament\u2026It\u2019s clear that he hasn\u2019t changed and has no interest in doing so. As a result, Donald Trump is a man I cannot support and should not support. The actions of the last day are disgusting, but that\u2019s not why I reached this decision, it has been an accumulation of his words and actions that many have been warning about. I will not vote for a nominee who has behaved in a manner that reflects so poorly on our country. Our country deserves better.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R, Florida\n\nResponse: \u201cDonald\u2019s comments were vulgar, egregious & impossible to justify.\n\nNo one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nGov. Scott Walker, R, Wisconsin\n\nResponse: \u201cInexcusable. Trump\u2019s comments are inexcusable.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nFORMER GOV/REP/SENATORS\n\nFmr. Gov. Jon Huntsman, R, Utah\n\nResponse: \u201cIn a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom \u2014 at such a critical moment for our nation \u2014 and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? Yes\n\nFmr. Gov. Mitt Romney, R, Mass.\n\nResponse: \u201cHitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No\n\nFmr. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\n\nResponse: \u201cEnough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw. As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth.\u201d\n\nFmr. Rep. Joe Walsh, R, Illinois\n\nResponse: \u201cCut it out all u Republican pols w your fake outrage. We\u2019ve all known this about Trump. Don\u2019t act surprised now. It\u2019s still him or Hillary\u201d\n\nOTHER REPUBLICANS\n\nAna Navarro, former Jeb Bush adviser/Republican strategist\n\nResponse: \u201cIt is time to ask [Trump] to step down \u2026 he is not fit to be the Republican nominee, he is not fit to be called a man.\u201d\n\nTrump endorsement? No", "url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/headline-republicans-react-trump-comments-objectifying-women"}, "article2": {"title": "Here's the analytical error that's causing Republicans to back Trump", "content": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nIn my May 31 column on Donald Trump and the unacceptable tail risks he poses \u2014 such as possibly defaulting on US-government debt \u2014 I quoted Marco Rubio because he seemed, in February, to understand the tail-risk argument against Trump.\n\nYou don't give \"the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual,\" advised Rubio \u2014 not because Trump is probably going to employ those codes, but because the risk of him doing so is unacceptably high.\n\nNow, Rubio is supporting Trump, even as he refuses to retract his past criticisms, including that quite devastating one about the nuclear codes. How is that possible?\n\nDavid Frum explains the thinking that allows establishment Republicans to justify their tortured endorsements of Trump in his new Atlantic piece about how Trump has broken many of the protective guardrails in American politics.\n\n\"Once you've convinced yourself that a president of the other party is the very worst possible thing that could befall America,\" Frum writes, \"then any nominee of your party \u2014 literally no matter who \u2014 becomes a lesser evil.\"\n\nMany American politicians have gotten so used to demonizing candidates from the other party \u2014 talking about them as not merely people who will make bad policy, but as people who will destroy the country. They no longer have a vocabulary for talking about outcomes \u2014 like nuclear war \u2014 that are worse than being governed by the other party.\n\nIndeed, Rubio now says that he's \"even more scared about\" Clinton than Trump, and that he \"can't live with\" a Clinton presidency.\n\nOf course, that's nonsense. Rubio already lived with a Clinton presidency, not to mention a Carter presidency and an Obama presidency. He'll live with another Clinton presidency just fine.\n\nYou can tell that Rubio knows this on some level because, unlike with Trump, he doesn't talk about having unease about Clinton and the nuclear button. That's because, whatever her many flaws, there's no greater reason to fear Clinton will up and use nuclear weapons than there was with any recent president of either party. There is a good reason to fear this with Trump.\n\nBut the one thing you can't do in politics is admit that there's an outcome worse than the other party winning, and Rubio knows it.\n\nThis rule puts Rubio and Republicans like him in the absurd position of acting like capital-gains tax policy is more important than nuclear war \u2014 and of urging voters to take the risk of a global calamity rather than voting against their party. But hey, that's how it works.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/why-republicans-support-trump-2016-5"}, "article3": {"title": "The History Behind the Donald Trump 'Small Hands' Insult", "content": "Almost 30 years ago Trump was described as a \"short-fingered vulgarian.\"\n\n\u2014 -- Marco Rubio told supporters last week that GOP presidential rival Donald Trump is \"always calling me 'little Marco.'\"\n\n\"He is taller than me, he's like 6' 2\", which is why I don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5' 2\",\" Rubio joked. \"Have you seen his hands? And you know what they say about men with small hands -- \"\n\nThe crowd erupted.\n\n\" -- You can't trust them,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio\u2019s comment may come across tasteless for a presidential hopeful, but that was not the first time someone has questioned the size of Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair magazine, described Trump in Spy magazine as a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d\n\nIn an editor\u2019s letter in \"Vanity Fair\" last November, Carter said that he wrote the Sky magazine comment in 1988 \"just to drive him a little bit crazy.\"\n\nAnd according to Carter, it still does.\n\n\"Like so many bullies, Trump has skin of gossamer,\" Carter wrote in November.\n\n\"To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him\u2014generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers,\" Carter wrote. \"I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.\"\n\n\"The most recent offering arrived earlier this year, before his decision to go after the Republican presidential nomination,\" Carter continued. \"Like the other packages, this one included a circled hand and the words, also written in gold Sharpie: 'See, not so short!' I sent the picture back by return mail with a note attached, saying, 'Actually, quite short.'\"\n\nAnd Carter's theory that Trump is ultra-sensitive to this particular insult appears to be right.\n\nIf you thought Rubio's joke on the campaign trail last week would go un-answered by Trump -- you were wrong.\n\nTrump has brought up his hands up at least twice in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt a rally outside Detroit this morning, Trump said he would not sit back and be \u201cpresidential\u2026when \u2018little Marco\u2019\" talked about \"the size of my hands.\"\n\nTrump held his hands up and said, \"Those hands can hit a golf ball 285 yards.\"\n\nAnd at the Republican debate in Detroit last night, Trump said, \"And I have to say this, I have to say this. [Rubio] hit my hands.\"\n\n\"Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this,\" Trump continued, neglecting to reveal his repeated mailings to Carter.\n\n\"Look at those hands,\" Trump said on the debate stage, holding up his hands to the audience. \"Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands -- if they are small, something else must be small.\"\n\n\"I guarantee you there is no problem,\" Trump affirmed. \"I guarantee you.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/history-donald-trump-small-hands-insult/story?id=37395515"}}
