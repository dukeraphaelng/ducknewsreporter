That question is always asked to me, who do you have in mind, and I don\u2019t even think about VP right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to win.

REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich\n\nPalin, the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter, endorsed conservative businessman Paul Nehlen, who is challenging Ryan, the House speaker, for his congressional seat in the Wisconsin Republican nominating contest on Aug. 9.\n\n\u201cI will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen,\u201d Palin said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThis man is a hardworking guy, so in touch with the people.\u201d\n\nThough Ryan is heavily favored to win the primary race against Nehlen, Palin predicted an upset in a race she said would shock Washington\u2019s political class.\n\nPalin\u2019s comments underscore the deep divisions within the party over Trump, who effectively locked up his party\u2019s nomination for president last week when his two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the race.\n\nPalin said she believed Ryan would get \u201cCantored,\u201d comparing him to former Eric Cantor, the former No. 2 Republican in the House who was defeated in a 2014 primary by conservative Dave Brat, now a Virginia congressman.\n\nRyan said last week he was not ready to support Trump yet, saying that the New York real estate mogul needed to do more to unify the Republican party.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is that they become so disconnected from the people they are elected to represent, as evidenced by Paul Ryan\u2019s refusal to support the GOP front runner, that we just said, \u2018He\u2019s our man,\u2019\u201d Palin said.\n\nA poll in March by Marquette University Law School showed Ryan with more than an 80 percent approval rating among Wisconsin Republicans.\n\nSeen as an intellectual leader of the party\u2019s conservative values, many inside the party believe he may mount his own White House run in the next presidential cycle.\n\nNehlen, like Trump, wants to secure the southern border with Mexico and withdraw from global trade deals. He told Reuters in April that Cantor\u2019s defeat in 2014 \u201creinforced in my mind\u201d that he could defeat Ryan.\n\nAsked if she would be willing to be vetted as a potential vice presidential candidate, Palin said she recognizes many voters might not want her on the ticket and that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to be a burden\u201d to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nPalin, who is popular with the Tea Party wing of the Republican party, was tapped in 2008 to be the running mate for former Republican presidential nominee John McCain.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-palin-idUSKCN0XZ0S2"}, "article3": {"title": "Sarah Palin Endorses Donald Trump, Which Could Bolster Him in Iowa", "content": "As Mrs. Palin announced her backing, Mr. Trump stood wearing a satisfied smile as she scolded mainstream Republicans as sellouts and praised how Mr. Trump had shaken up the party. \u201cHe\u2019s been going rogue left and right,\u201d Mrs. Palin said of Mr. Trump, using one of her signature phrases. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s doing so well. He\u2019s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the system.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear that Mrs. Palin\u2019s blessing will have a major impact on Mr. Trump\u2019s long-term prospects. But in Iowa, where Mrs. Palin spent years developing a network of supporters, it could be helpful. Mr. Trump has faced questions about whether his campaign\u2019s organizing muscle can draw the voters to match his poll numbers come caucus night.\n\n\u201cOver the years Palin has actually cultivated a number of relationships in Iowa,\u201d said Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa and publisher of the website The Iowa Republican. \u201cThere are the Tea Party activists who still think she\u2019s great and a breath of fresh air, but she also did a good job of courting Republican donors in the state,\u201d he added.\n\nOther conservatives said that Mrs. Palin serves as a particularly effective shield against Mr. Cruz, who has assiduously courted Iowa\u2019s evangelical voters.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/us/politics/donald-trump-sarah-palin.html"}}
