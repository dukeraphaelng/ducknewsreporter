Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We\u2019re lucky to have her. She\u2019s controversial, but she\u2019s one of the good ones.\u201d\n\nThe above-displayed story is not true, and Trump has no outreach program with that name. This is a work of fiction from National Report, a well-known purveyor of fake news. A disclaimer on the site states that the publication is news and political satire:\n\nAll news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.\n\nWhile Stacey Dash has not been hired by Donald Trump to run any type of outreach campaign, she did endorse the Republican presidential candidate, and is a supporter of the pro-Trump Great America PAC:", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stacey-dash-donald-trump-outreach/"}, "article2": {"title": "Stacey Dash, \u2018Clueless\u2019 Actress And One-Time Oscar Punchline, Running For Congress", "content": "Clueless star/former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash has made it official: she\u2019s running for Congress in California.\n\nThe actress on Monday filed docs to run in California\u2019s 44th district, which encompasses Compton, Watts, San Pedro and North Long Beach; it has been a Dem stronghold for years; these days repped by Nanette Barrag\u00e1n. It\u2019s a district that overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016; Dash is Republican.\n\nEarlier this month, Dash hinted the move was in the works:\n\nA number of people online and off have suggested I run for political office. I wanted to see what my online community thinks of this idea as I mull the possibilities. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/L71fF0NnXR \u2014 Stacey Dash (@REALStaceyDash) February 9, 2018\n\nA Donald Trump endorsement cannot be far behind.\n\nIn January of 2016, when Dash weighed in on Fox & Friends about the lack of diversity in that year\u2019s Oscar nominations, her remarks drew praise from then-candidate Trump.\n\n\u201cWe have to make up our minds,\u201d she opined. \u201cEither we have segregation or integration. If we don\u2019t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards \u2014 where you\u2019re only awarded if you\u2019re black. If it were the other way around, we\u2019d be up in arms.\u201d Dash also insisted there \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a Black History Month. We\u2019re Americans, period. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThen GOP presidential race frontrunner Trump gave F&F his two cents\u2019 worth on the Oscars flap, telling F&F\u2019s co-hosts Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, and Anna Kooiman, \u201cI saw somebody on your show today saying, \u2018Well, what do we do with BET?\u2019 The whites don\u2019t get any nominations. I thought it was an amazing interview, actually. I\u2019d never even thought about it from that standpoint.\u201d\n\nAt the 2016 Oscars, host Chris Rock got in on the exchange when he brought Dash on stage at the awards ceremony, saying the Academy had taken steps to fix the lack of opportunity for black actors, and naming Dash director of its minority outreach program.\n\n\u201cI cannot wait to help my people out. Happy Black History Month!\u201d Dash told Oscar-goers then giggled nervously as the audience reacted with silence. \u201cThank you,\u201d she added, then dashed off stage. It was unclear if attendees had any idea who she was, much less the gag.\n\n\u201cI just walked offstage from the Oscars and where I got no applause,\u201d she said after her brief appearance. \u201cNo boos. Nothing. People were awestruck, which was a little disappointing. But I did it because I wanted to. I stand in my position, and Chris asked me to do it and I love him and I support him. And I also think I should be the head of diversity at the Oscars. I think I\u2019m the perfect person to do that.\u201d\n\nBased on the social media strength of that Oscar gig, Dash got cast as the mayor of Chicago in Syfy\u2019s Sharknado: The 4th Awakens. By then, Trump was within spitting distance of the White House, so Dash made perfect sense as mayor of a city struggling with racial strife. Things didn\u2019t go so well for Mayor Dash; she got crushed by a house, Wicked-Witch style.\n\nIn January of \u201917, when Fox News Channel covered Trump\u2019s first full week in the White House, it did so with a culled crop of contributors. Among the departed: George Will and Dash \u2013 two names never before used in the same sentence.", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/02/clueless-stacey-dash-running-for-congress-california-1202303859/"}, "article3": {"title": "Stacey Dash shows support for Donald Trump calling him a 'true conservative'", "content": "For more of the latest on Donald Trump visit www.dailymail.co.uk/trump\n\nShe recently called for the elimination of Black History Month and the cable channel BET\n\nDash, who made a surprise appearance at the Oscars last Sunday, is now a contributor for Fox News\n\nbut has yet to endorse a candidate\n\npraised Trump since he announced he was running for president last June,\n\nStacey Dash showed her support for Donald Trump on Thursday ahead of the Republican debate.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Dash said of Trump; 'I believe he is a true conservative.

Just like there shouldn't be a Black History Month. You know? We're Americans. Period. That's it.'\n\nDash, 49, had previously discussed eliminating Black History Month and BET in a post on her blog late last year.\n\nShe wrote at the time; 'I don\u2019t need a special month or special channel. What\u2019s sad is that these insidious things only keep us segregated and invoke false narratives.'\n\nDash, who shot to fame with her role as Dionne in the film Clueless, is now a contributor to Fox News.\n\nShe voted for President Barack Obama in the 2008 election but then switched her party affiliation in 2012 to Republican, endorsing Mitt Romney in the election.\n\nDash was born in the Bronx and is part Bajan, African American and Mexican.
