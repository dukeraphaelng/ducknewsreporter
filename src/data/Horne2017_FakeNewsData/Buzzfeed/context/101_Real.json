Bush said Monday that he will vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to the 41st President \u2013 an extraordinary rebuke of his own party\u2019s nominee.\n\nThe sources said this was not the first time Bush had disclosed his intention to vote for Clinton.\n\nThe comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation when Bush was speaking to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor. There were roughly 40 people in the room, and it\u2019s not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did.\n\nThe Republican former president\u2019s embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics.\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning political move \u2013 one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects \u201cthe 92-year-old former president very much and his decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race,\u201d she added on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cBut look, this was a bruising primary \u2026 so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.\u201d\n\nNews of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook, when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W. Bush, along with the caption: \u201cThe President told me he\u2019s voting for Hillary!!\u201d\n\nKennedy Townsend sits on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation.\n\nBush family representatives declined to respond publicly.\n\n\u201cThe vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim,\u201d Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement.\n\nBut sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN they were surprised and disappointed that Kennedy Townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president.\n\nKennedy Townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the Rock Creek Group, where she works as managing director. She later took down the Facebook post.\n\nGOP\u2019s Trump divide\n\nTrump\u2019s controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees. Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter, calling him unfit for office. But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump, as has Arizona Sen. John McCain \u2013 though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to \u201cthe Republican nominee\u201d rather than Trump by name.\n\nNeither George H.W. Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election \u2013 even as Trump savaged George W. Bush\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq. However, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents\u2019 Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June, saying she \u201chas the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.\u201d George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he \u201cwould have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country.\u201d\n\nAnd Louis Wade Sullivan, the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W. Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet, said this month that \u201cthough my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBut George H.W. Bush isn\u2019t speaking for his entire family. Marvin Bush, the former president\u2019s youngest son, has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, George H.W. Bush\u2019s grandson, has backed Trump.\n\nAnd Jeb Bush, Trump\u2019s former primary rival, has said he won\u2019t vote for Trump or Clinton.\n\nA representative for George W. Bush wouldn\u2019t comment on Kennedy Townsend\u2019s Facebook post or how George H.W. Bush would vote. The representative simply said George W. Bush is \u201cspending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nThe Bush-Clinton relationship\n\nThe evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992, when Bill Clinton ran against \u2013 and defeated \u2013 incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Eight years later, with Clinton term-limited out of office, Bush\u2019s son, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, succeeded Clinton on a pledge to \u201crestore honor and dignity\u201d to the White House \u2013 a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton\u2019s marital infidelity.\n\nBut Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. And in recent years, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together.\n\nThe two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his \u201cbrother from another mother,\u201d and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers.\n\nA Bush-Clinton matchup\n\nEarly in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2013 the 41st president\u2019s son and the 43rd president\u2019s brother \u2013 was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse.\n\nEven if George H.W. Bush hadn\u2019t endorsed Hillary Clinton, it was hard to envision him backing Trump.\n\nNeither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump became the GOP\u2019s nominee \u2013 with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush, denounced repeatedly by Trump as \u201clow-energy,\u201d exited the race.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the context in which George H.W. Bush made his comment about voting for Hillary Clinton.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/george-hw-bush-hillary-clinton/index.html"}}
