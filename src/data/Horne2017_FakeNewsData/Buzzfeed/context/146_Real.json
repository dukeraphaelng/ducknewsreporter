Here\u2019s what happened:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday openly praised Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) for assaulting a reporter in his bid for Congress last year, as the United States faced an unfolding crisis over missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who is believed to have been killed by Saudi Arabian agents. The remarks from Trump at a campaign rally \u2014 staged at an airport hangar here with a mountainous backdrop \u2014 drew boisterous cheers from the conservative crowd, who applauded as Trump noted of Gianforte: \u201cBy the way, never wrestle him.\u201d \u201cAny guy that can do a body slam, he\u2019s my kind of \u2014 he\u2019s my guy,\u201d Trump said. Gianforte pleaded guilty to assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs, an altercation that occurred in the final days of Gianforte\u2019s special election race in May 2017 when Jacobs tried to interview him about the GOP health-care plan. The then-candidate grabbed Jacobs, threw him to the ground and punched him. Gianforte subsequently won the special election, and later pleaded guilty, receiving a six-month deferred sentence.\n\nWe should note that in addition to assaulting a reporter because he asked him a question about health care policy, Gianforte also lied to the police, claiming that Jacobs had grabbed him and they both fell to the ground. After an audio tape of Gianforte\u2019s assault was made public, he dropped the lie and admitted his guilt.\n\nAnyone who watched Trump\u2019s rallies during the 2016 election is well used to the fact that not only did the president regularly advocate violence, he talked about it with longing (\u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face\u201d), lamented when protesters weren\u2019t beaten sufficiently (\u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up,\u201d \u201cPart of the problem, and part of the reason it takes so long, is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right?\u201d) and instructed his followers to commit their own acts of violence (\u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, okay. Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise\u201d). Asked about all that, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, \u201cThe president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as important as the fact that Trump says these things is the response from his supporters. You can see it in the video: When he reminds them of the assault on Ben Jacobs, they laugh and cheer, exactly the response Trump anticipates. Which is why I want to point to another part of what Trump said:\n\nTrump recalled that as he was traveling in Rome last May, he heard that Gianforte had body-slammed a journalist shortly before voters went to the polls in his closely contested election race \u2014 and initially thought the altercation would damage Gianforte\u2019s prospects. \u201cThen I said, \u2018well wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well. I think it might help him,'\u201d Trump told the crowd in Missoula. \u201cAnd it did.\u201d\n\nWhile I doubt that Trump actually knows Montana well, what he does know is the Republican Party. And he was right about Gianforte. Not only did he win, but before that election was over he got enormous support from conservative media figures, who characterized the bizarrely unprovoked attack as an act of admirable masculinity, while mocking the reporter as insufficiently testosterone-fueled:\n\nRush Limbaugh called Gianforte \u201cmanly and studly.\u201d\n\nFox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy praised Gianforte for dispensing \u201cMontana justice.\u201d\n\nLaura Ingraham tweeted mockingly, \u201cDid anyone get his lunch money stolen today and then run to tell the recess monitor?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a wuss files charges over broken glasses?\u201d asked another conservative columnist. \u201cSomeone who wants to influence an outcome, that\u2019s who.\u201d\n\nTrump is in many ways an ignoramus and a fool, but he has one extraordinary political talent. Like a migratory bird perceiving the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, Trump has an uncanny sense for where to find the worst in people, particularly people on the right: their fears, their resentments, their hatreds, the things that will move them to a venomous and gleeful rage. Time and again when many in his party worried that something he (or someone else) said or did would be politically disastrous, Trump would be able say to them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The base is going to love this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe proved it in 2016 when every other Republican presidential candidate was dancing around the immigration issue and he busted in saying Mexican immigrants are rapists, build a wall, and ban the Muslims, which turned out to be exactly what the base wanted. And he keeps proving it. He knew the Republican base far better than the party\u2019s leaders did, because he understood how twisted their hearts really were.\n\nFollow this author Paul Waldman 's opinions Follow\n\nWhen you see Trump praising a violent assault committed by a Republican congressman to laughter and cheers, and at the very same rally pretending to be horrified that \u201cThe Democrats have truly turned into an angry mob,\u201d you might wonder whether the assembled crowd notices their own hypocrisy. But they just don\u2019t care. Trump has instructed them that worrying about stuff like that is for wimps. Those who criticize him or even point out inconvenient facts \u2014 Democrats, journalists \u2014 are not just wrong, they\u2019re enemies.\n\nAgainst enemies no tactic is out of bounds. You can lie about them, you can stir up the most vile hatred against them, you can encourage violence against them, you can even assault them, and none of it matters so long as you win. These are the principles that every fascist and authoritarian operates by, and they have become core principles of today\u2019s Republican Party.\n\nI picture Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman watching Trump in action and then asking himself, \u201cGee, I wonder if that guy really has a problem with me ordering the murder of a journalist I didn\u2019t like?\u201d And then he laughs and laughs.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/10/19/trump-encourages-violence-against-reporters-and-his-supporters-cheer/"}, "article2": {"title": "Trump budget opens new fight among Republicans", "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Todd Rokita keeps a clock hanging on the wall of his Capitol Hill office that tracks the U.S. government\u2019s rising debt in real time and reminds him of his top priority: reining in federal spending.\n\nPresident Donald Trump makes remarks to the press as he sits down for a working lunch with members of his cabinet and their spouses, including Veteran's Administration Secretary David Shulkin (L) and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (R), at Trump National Golf Club, Potomac Falls,Virginia, in suburban Washington, U.S., March 11, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\n\u201cI was sent here on a fiscal note,\u201d said the Indiana lawmaker and vice chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, who rode a Republican wave during his first election to Congress in 2010.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump unveils his budget for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday, Rokita will be among many conservative Republicans cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup.\n\nMore moderate Republicans are less enthusiastic and worry Trump\u2019s budget could force lawmakers to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly.\n\n\u201cWhat you would hope is that the administration is aware of the difficulty of some of these things,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma.\n\nThe release of Trump\u2019s budget, which comes as the Republican president is facing an intraparty revolt over proposed legislation to replace the Obamacare healthcare law, could open another fight among Republicans who control both houses of Congress. To keep the government running, lawmakers will need to approve a spending plan later this year.\n\nThe White House has released few details about Trump\u2019s budget, other than making clear the president wants to boost military spending by $54 billion and is seeking equivalent cuts in non-defense discretionary programs.\n\nBut several agencies, including the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, have been asked to prepare scenarios for steep reductions, according to officials familiar with the discussions.\n\nWhile supporting deficit-reduction efforts, Cole said a major research university in his district could get hit by National Institutes of Health cuts, as could sewage treatment facilities funded by the EPA.\n\nRepublican Senator Rob Portman, whose home state of Ohio sits on the southern shores of Lake Erie, expressed concern about media reports saying the Trump budget had penciled in sharp cuts in a cleanup program for the Great Lakes.\n\nNOT AUSTERE ENOUGH\n\nWhile Rokita, who was among a group of Republican lawmakers who met with Trump last week, appeared comfortable with what he had learned so far about Trump\u2019s budget, some Republican members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said they wanted to see even further budget cuts.\n\nRepresentative Mo Brooks of Alabama said the outcry from lawmakers over the expected cuts underscored to him that the blueprint would be a \u201ca very large step in the right direction\u201d of reining in the debt.\n\nBrooks added: \u201cMy fear is that the Trump budget will not be austere enough to minimize America\u2019s risk of suffering the kind of debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that is destroying the lives of Venezuelans right now.\u201d\n\nOPEC member Venezuela is immersed in a deep economic crisis, with inflation in triple digits, shortages of basic goods, and many people going hungry.\n\nBrooks and other members of the Freedom Caucus are among the most vocal critics of the legislation backed by the White House to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare plan, known as Obamacare.\n\nTo try to woo the conservative lawmakers on Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, budget director Mick Mulvaney, himself a former member of the House Freedom Caucus, has invited them to a bowling and pizza night at the White House on Tuesday night.\n\nAnother Freedom Caucus member, Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, said Mulvaney was encouraging lawmakers to submit maverick fiscal ideas to the White House.\n\nSchweikert said he hoped to revive a proposal from a few years ago, in the midst of a fight over raising the U.S. debt limit, that would have allowed the government to take a series of alternative, albeit controversial steps, such as paying some creditors ahead of others.\n\n\u2018SLASH AND BURN\u2019\n\nOne senior Republican aide, who referred to Trump\u2019s budget as a \u201cslash and burn\u201d proposal, said one fear of some House lawmakers was that they would be pressured to back big spending cuts only to have them rejected by the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer majority. The risk for House members is that their votes could prompt a backlash in the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a budget that cuts State Department funds by one-third is unlikely to pass in his chamber.\n\nOther high-ranking Republicans are setting off alarms.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, following a White House lunch on Tuesday with Trump, said: \u201cWhat I told him is that when we get in a deadlock between the House and the Senate, different factions of the party ... you\u2019re the guy who needs to come down and close the deal.\u201d\n\nCole said Congress would ultimately have the final say on the budget.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019ll have a budget. We\u2019ll pass the budget,\u201d he said. \u201cOur budget is not necessarily the president\u2019s budget.\u201d", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-idUSKBN16K008"}, "article3": {"title": "Transcript of Donald Trump\u2019s Immigration Speech", "content": "(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren\u2019t known because the media won\u2019t report on them. The politicians won\u2019t talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That\u2019s the way it is.\n\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It\u2019s all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn\u2019t serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you. But if we\u2019re going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it\u2019s impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\n\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it\u2019s just not going to work out. It\u2019s our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/politics/transcript-trump-immigration-speech.html"}}
