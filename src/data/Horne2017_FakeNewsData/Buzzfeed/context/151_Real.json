Only one Republican-controlled seat, in Illinois, fell to Democrats early in the evening. And Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, easily won re-election in a race that had been among the country\u2019s most competitive. A handful of other Republican incumbents facing difficult races were running better than expected.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s win \u2014 stretching across the battleground states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 seemed likely to set off financial jitters and immediate unease among international allies, many of which were startled when Mr. Trump in his campaign cast doubt on the necessity of America\u2019s military commitments abroad and its allegiance to international economic partnerships.\n\nFrom the moment he entered the campaign, with a shocking set of claims that Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals, Mr. Trump was widely underestimated as a candidate, first by his opponents for the Republican nomination and later by Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic rival. His rise was largely missed by polling organizations and data analysts. And an air of improbability trailed his campaign, to the detriment of those who dismissed his angry message, his improvisational style and his appeal to disillusioned voters.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-president.html"}, "article2": {"title": "How Russia Helped Swing the Election for Trump", "content": "If the WikiLeaks release was a Russian-backed effort to rescue Trump\u2019s candidacy by generating a scandal to counterbalance the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and the intelligence report on Russian interference, Jamieson writes, it worked splendidly. The intelligence community\u2019s report faded from the headlines; that Sunday morning, none of its authors were invited on any major talk show. Instead, the programs breathlessly discussed the \u201cpussy\u201d tape and the Clinton campaign\u2019s e-mails, which were portrayed as more or less exposing both candidates as liars. Jamieson notes, \u201cInstead of asking how we could know that the Russians were behind the hacking, the October 9 Sunday show moderators asked what effect the disclosures would have on the candidates\u2019 respective campaigns and what the tape and speech segments revealed about the private versus public selves of the contenders.\u201d If not for WikiLeaks, she writes, the media discourse in those crucial days likely would have remained locked on two topics advantageous to Clinton: Russian election subversion and Trump\u2019s treatment of women.\n\nJamieson also argues that, in most hotly contested elections, the candidates blunt each other\u2019s messages, which results in fairly balanced media coverage. In 2016, she believes, Russia\u2019s involvement upset this equilibrium. She asks readers to imagine how different the 2016 election might have been if Trump\u2019s campaign had also been hacked, disgorging the e-mails of Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump, Jr. Among other things, this would have exposed correspondence about the notorious June, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump\u2019s payoffs to a pornographic actress and to a Playboy model. Documents that Trump has kept concealed, such as his tax returns, also might have come to light. Instead, Jamieson writes, throughout the autumn of 2016 a steady stream of content stolen from the Clinton campaign\u2014which the press generally described as coming from WikiLeaks, rather than from Russia\u2014\u201creweighted the news environment in Trump\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\nAs Jamieson dug further into Russia\u2019s discourse saboteurs, she decided that she had the makings of a book. Most discussions about the 2016 election results, she believed, had been misguidedly framed around the question of whether the Russians had \u201cchanged votes directly.\u201d There wasn\u2019t evidence for this. Instead, she suspected, the Russians had \u201cinfluenced who voted, or didn\u2019t vote, and that could have changed the outcome.\u201d\n\nShe set aside her debates project and continued sleuthing. She amassed more evidence this past February, when the Justice Department, in connection with the Mueller probe, released a detailed indictment of thirteen Russians working at the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm in St. Petersburg. The operatives were described as having worked day and night waging \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America.\u201d Then, in July, Mueller indicted twelve Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The indictment maintained that the Russian government had executed a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, infiltrating their computers and implanting malware that, in some instances, enabled spies to covertly monitor their keystrokes. As the Times reported, the Russians had leaked stolen files \u201cin stages,\u201d a tactic \u201cthat wreaked havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season.\u201d\n\nStrikingly, the July indictment showed that Russian hackers\u2019 first attempt to infiltrate the computer servers in Clinton\u2019s personal offices had taken place on July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump had declared, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the thirty thousand e-mails that are missing,\u201d adding, \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d\n\nAnother revelation from the indictment which jumped out at Jamieson was that the Russian hackers had stolen the Clinton campaign\u2019s data analytics and voter-turnout models. A month later, when we met in Philadelphia, Jamieson said, \u201cSo we\u2019re starting to close in on a pretty strong inference that they had everything needed to target the messaging\u201d at \u201ckey constituencies that did effectively mobilize in this election.\u201d Cocking an eyebrow, she added, \u201cThe possibility that this happened starts to become a probability\u2014starts to become a likelihood\u2014pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nJoel Benenson, the Clinton pollster, was stunned when he learned, from the July indictment, that the Russians had stolen his campaign\u2019s internal modelling. \u201cI saw it and said, \u2018Holy shit!\u2019 \u201d he told me. Among the proprietary information that the Russian hackers could have obtained, he said, was campaign data showing that, late in the summer of 2016, in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, an unusually high proportion of residents whose demographic and voting profiles identified them as likely Democrats were \u201cHillary defectors\u201d: people so unhappy with Clinton that they were considering voting for a third-party candidate. The Clinton campaign had a plan for winning back these voters. Benenson explained that any Clinton opponent who stole this data would surely have realized that the best way to counter the plan was to bombard those voters with negative information about Clinton. \u201cAll they need to do is keep that person where they are,\u201d he said, which is far easier than persuading a voter to switch candidates. Many critics have accused Clinton of taking Michigan and Wisconsin for granted and spending virtually no time there. But Benenson said that, if a covert social-media campaign targeting \u201cHillary defectors\u201d was indeed launched in battleground states, it might well have changed the outcome of the election.\n\nBenenson said, \u201cWe lost Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin\u2014three states of our Blue Wall\u2014by about eighty thousand votes. Six hundred and sixty thousand votes were cast in those three states for third-party candidates. Winning those three states would have got us to two hundred and seventy-eight electoral votes.\u201d In other words, if only twelve per cent of those third-party voters were persuaded by Russian propaganda\u2014based on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics\u2014not to vote for Clinton, then Jamieson\u2019s theory could be valid.\n\nBenenson said that, when he first learned about the theft, he \u201ccalled another consultant on the campaign and said, \u2018This is unreal.\u2019 \u201d The consultant reminded him that, in focus groups with undecided voters in the fall of 2016, \u201cwe\u2019d hear these things like \u2018I really hate Trump, but Hillary\u2019s going to murder all these people\u2019\u2014all sorts of crazy stuff.\u201d Benenson admitted that many Americans had long disliked the Clintons, and had for years spread exaggerated rumors of their alleged misdeeds and deceptions. But he wonders if some of those conspiracy-minded voters hadn\u2019t been unknowingly influenced by Russian propagandists who were marshalling the Clinton campaign\u2019s own analytics.\n\nPhilip Howard, the director of the Oxford Internet Institute, in England, agrees that the Russian interference could have been decisive, but he is less convinced that the stolen analytics were key. He told me, \u201cIt\u2019s plausible, but the Russians wouldn\u2019t have needed the Clinton campaign\u2014they could just as easily have targeted the network of Bernie Sanders supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid we make mistakes?\u201d Benenson asked, about the Clinton campaign\u2019s performance. \u201cSure.\u201d But, he said, he believes that Russian interference in the 2016 election was \u201cthe biggest threat to democracy we\u2019ve ever had in this country, other than the wars we\u2019ve had to fight.\u201d\n\nJamieson has long been respected by the Washington media establishment, but it\u2019s a safe bet that the Trump White House will dismiss her work as more \u201cfake news.\u201d A senior Trump adviser who was involved in the 2016 campaign, and has yet to see Jamieson\u2019s book, recently sent me a text: \u201cWhere is the evidence? And when do people start to feel ashamed that they can\u2019t accept the election results and the crappy candidate they ran?\u201d\n\nOther academics may also be skeptical of \u201cCyberwar.\u201d A forthcoming book on the 2016 campaign, \u201cIdentity Crisis,\u201d by the political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, argues that Russian interference was not a major factor in the Presidential election, and that the hacked e-mails \u201cdid not clearly affect\u201d perceptions of Clinton. Instead, they write, Trump\u2019s exploitation of divisive race, gender, religious, and ethnicity issues accounted for his win. But the two books are not necessarily incompatible: Jamieson shows that Russian saboteurs inflamed polarizing identity issues, including resentment among whites that minority groups were benefitting at the expense of \u201creal\u201d Americans\u2014which is exactly what \u201cIdentity Crisis\u201d says swung the election.\n\nRecently, Brendan Nyhan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, suggested, in the Times, that most fears about the impact of Russian information warfare in the 2016 campaign are exaggerated. He wrote that \u201ca growing number of studies conclude\u201d that \u201cmost forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all,\u201d and cited studies suggesting that television ads, direct mail, and door-to-door canvassing rarely sway voters. Moreover, he argued, though the number of Russian-sponsored messages during the 2016 campaign might sound alarmingly large, the universe of information that most voters are exposed to is so vast that the impact of fake news, and other malicious online misinformation, is diluted. He noted, \u201cTwitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election\u2014certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\u201d He concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change people\u2019s minds!\u201d\n\nConservative news outlets like the Daily Caller have embraced the view that Russia\u2019s social-media operations were negligible. But Jonathan Albright, of Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, who has been at the forefront of documenting the spread of online disinformation from Russia and other sources, describes the \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d argument as a case of \u201cfalse framing.\u201d He told me, \u201cA better way to think of it is not as a drop of solution but as pollution. Every piece of messaging has some effect.\u201d It\u2019s misleading, he says, to focus only on the relatively small number of obvious propaganda messages, such as paid Facebook ads. Far more important, in the 2016 campaign, was \u201corganic content\u201d: the countless messages, created by masked Russian social-media accounts, that were spread by algorithms, bots, and unwitting American users. The reach of such content, he told me, \u201cturned out to be huge.\u201d Of the four hundred and seventy Facebook accounts known to have been created by Russian saboteurs during the campaign, a mere six of them generated content that was shared at least three hundred and forty million times. The Facebook page for a fake group, Blacktivist, which stoked racial tensions by posting militant slogans and stomach-churning videos of police violence against African-Americans, garnered more hits than the Facebook page for Black Lives Matter.", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump"}, "article3": {"title": "US election 2016: What really happened with the Clintons in Haiti?", "content": "\"Since 2010, the Foundation has worked on the ground in Haiti with a range of partners - helping more than 7,500 farmers lift themselves out of poverty; improving the Haitian environment by planting more than 5 million trees and installing more than 400 KW of clean energy; and supporting women through literacy training and job skills for over 2,000 women.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37826098"}}
