For details about investigations into hacking and efforts to interfere with the election, see 2016 Presidential Election Investigation Fast Facts.\n\nTimeline\n\nSeptember 2015 - The FBI contacts the Democratic National Committee\u2019s help desk, cautioning the IT department that at least one computer has been compromised by Russian hackers. A technician scans the system and does not find anything suspicious.\n\nNovember 2015 - The FBI reaches out to the DNC again, warning them that one of their computers is transmitting information back to Russia. DNC management later says that IT technicians failed to pass along the message that the system had been breached.\n\nMarch 19, 2016 - Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta receives a phishing email masked as an alert from Google that another user had tried to access his account. It contains a link to a page where Podesta can change his password. He shares the email with a staffer from the campaign\u2019s help desk. The staffer replies with a typo - instead of typing \u201cThis is an illegitimate email,\u201d the staffer types \u201cThis is a legitimate email.\u201d Podesta follows the instructions and types a new password, allowing hackers to access his emails.\n\nApril 2016 - Hackers create a fake email account and use it to send spear-phishing emails to more than thirty Clinton staffers, according to investigators. In the emails, the hackers embed a link purporting to direct the recipient to a document titled \u201chillaryclinton-favorable-rating.xlsx.\u201d The link directs the recipients\u2019 computers to a website operated by the hackers. That same month, hackers use stolen credentials to access the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee computer network, stealing data with malware. They ultimately access 33 DNC computers and anonymously register a website called DC Leaks to publicize the release of documents.\n\nMay-June 2016 - The hackers steal thousands of emails from the DNC server and begin to conceal their efforts.\n\nJune 12, 2016 - During an interview on British television, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says that the website has obtained and will publish a batch of campaign emails.\n\nJune 14, 2016 - The Washington Post reports hackers working for the Russian government accessed the DNC\u2019s computer system, stealing oppositional research on Trump and viewing staffers\u2019 emails and chat exchanges. The Kremlin, however, denies that the government was linked to the hack and a US official tells CNN that investigators have not yet concluded that the cyberattack was directed by the Russian government.\n\nJune 15, 2016 - Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC, posts a public notice on its website describing an attack on the political committee\u2019s computer network by two groups associated with Russian intelligence. According to the post, two groups called \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cFancy Bear\u201d tunneled into the committee\u2019s computer system. In response, the hackers create a persona called Guccifer 2.0, a self-described Romanian blogger who claims that he alone conducted the theft.\n\nJuly 22, 2016 - Days before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks publishes nearly 20,000 emails hacked from the DNC server. The documents include notes in which DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insults staffers from the Bernie Sanders campaign as well as messages that suggest the organization was favoring Clinton rather than remaining neutral. Wasserman Schultz resigns as DNC chair in the aftermath of the leak.\n\nJuly 25, 2016 - The FBI announces it has launched an investigation into the hack. Officials tell CNN they think the cyberattack is linked to Russia.\n\nJuly 27, 2016 - During a press conference, Trump talks about Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and calls on hackers to find deleted emails. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d says Trump. Newt Gingrich, a Trump surrogate, defends Trump in a Tweet, dismissing the comment as a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nAugust 12, 2016 - Hackers publish cell phone numbers and personal email addresses for Nancy Pelosi and members of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nSeptember 1, 2016 - During an interview with Bloomberg News, Russian President Vladimir Putin says that he and the Russian government have no ties to the hackers. He says that the identity of the culprit or culprits is not as important as the content of the leaks and ultimately the hackers have revealed important information for voters.\n\nSeptember 22, 2016 - Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Adam Schiff, ranking members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, issue a joint statement declaring that based on information they received during congressional briefings, they believe Russian intelligence agencies are carrying out a plan to interfere with the election. They call on Putin to order a halt to the activities.\n\nSeptember 26, 2016 - During a presidential debate, Trump questions whether the DNC cyberattack was carried out by a state-sponsored group or a lone hacker. \u201cIt could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\u201d\n\nOctober-November 2016 - Over the course of a month, WikiLeaks publishes more than 58,000 messages hacked from Podesta\u2019s account.\n\nOctober 6, 2016 - DC Leaks publishes a batch of documents stolen from Clinton ally Capricia Marshall.\n\nOctober 7, 2016 - The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of National Intelligence on Election Security issue a statement declaring that the intelligence community is \u201cconfident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions.\u201d According to the statement, document releases on websites WikiLeaks and DCLeaks mirror the methods and motivations of past Russian-directed cyberattacks.\n\nNovember 29, 2016 - Democratic senators send a letter to President Barack Obama calling on intelligence agencies to declassify information about \u201cthe Russian Government and the US election.\u201d Sources later tell CNN that new intelligence has been shared with lawmakers suggesting that Russia\u2019s purpose for meddling in the election was to sway voters towards Trump, rather than broadly undermining confidence in the system.\n\nDecember 9, 2016 - The Washington Post reports the CIA has determined that Russian hacking was conducted to boost Trump and hurt Clinton. The Trump transition team dismisses the report and criticizes the CIA. Obama asks intelligence agencies to review the hacking incidents and other cyberattacks on political campaigns dating back to 2008. The agencies are asked to deliver their findings before Obama leaves office on January 20. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman expresses skepticism about the review and asks US investigators to share their evidence of government-sponsored cyber espionage.\n\nDecember 10, 2016 - John McCain, Chuck Schumer, Lindsey Graham and Jack Reed issue a joint statement calling on Congress to work on securing future elections and stopping cyberattacks.\n\nDecember 11, 2016 - Sources tell CNN that although US intelligence agencies share the belief that Russia played a role in the computer hacks, there is disagreement between the CIA and the FBI about the intent of the meddling. While the CIA assessment shows that the Russians may have sought to damage Clinton and help Trump, the FBI has yet to find proof that the attacks were orchestrated to elect the Republican candidate, according to unnamed officials. Furthermore, some sources say the hackers also infiltrated the Republican National Committee\u2019s computers.\n\nDecember 12, 2016 - CNN reports that Russian hackers accessed computer accounts of Republican lawmakers and GOP organizations. A source with knowledge of the investigation says that even though hackers breached the GOP computers, they opted not to release documents.\n\nDecember 13, 2016 - The New York Times publishes a detailed account of the DNC\u2019s delayed response to initial warnings in September of 2015 that its network had been infiltrated by hackers. The report outlines how phishing emails and communication failures led to a sweeping cyberattack. The story also lays out evidence that Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks were linked to Russia. A second article in the Times chronicles the hacking of the DCCC. According to the report, Guccifer 2.0 stole tens of thousands of documents and offered them to reporters in districts where Democratic candidates were engaged in competitive races for House seats.\n\nDecember 29, 2016 - Obama issues an executive order with sanctions against Russia. The order names six Russian individuals who allegedly took part in the hacking. Additionally, 35 Russian diplomats are ordered to leave the United States within 72 hours.\n\nJanuary 3, 2017 - Assange says that the Russian government did not provide him with the hacked DNC emails during an interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel.\n\nJanuary 3-4, 2017 - In a series of tweets, Trump questions the US intelligence community\u2019s claims that the Russian government interfered with the election. He alleges that intelligence officials have delayed a scheduled meeting with him but sources tell CNN that there has been no change to the schedule. Trump also cites Assange\u2019s interview to back his assertion that a rogue hacker, not the Russian government, may have meddled in the election.\n\nJanuary 5-6, 2017 - Intelligence officials meet separately with Obama and Trump to present the results of their probe into cyber espionage during the presidential campaign. After the president and the president-elect are briefed, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a declassified version of its classified report on Russian meddling. According to the report, hackers did not breach voting machines or computers that tallied election results but Russians meddled in other ways. Putin ordered a multifaceted influence campaign that included spreading pro-Trump propaganda online and hacking the DNC and Podesta, according to the report. Bracing for a possible Clinton win, Russian bloggers were prepared to promote a hashtag #DemocracyRIP on election night. Paid social media users shared stories about Clinton controversies to create a cloud of scandal around her campaign.\n\nJanuary 6-7, 2017 - Trump issues a statement after his meeting with intelligence officials. In the statement, he acknowledges that the Russian government may have been linked to the DNC hacking but declares that cyberattacks did not impact the outcome of the election because voting machines were not breached. In a series of tweets, he repeats that hacking did not affect election results and says that he wants to improve relations with Russia.\n\nMarch 10, 2017 - In an interview with the Washington Times, Trump ally Roger Stone says that he had limited interactions via Twitter with Guccifer 2.0 during the campaign. He says the exchanges were \u201ccompletely innocuous.\u201d The following day, the New York Times publishes its own interview with Stone, in which he says that his communication with Guccifer 2.0 took place after the DNC hack, proving there was no collusion with the Trump campaign to arrange the cyberattack.\n\nMay 17, 2017 - Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoints former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead an investigation into Russian interference and related matters that could result in criminal prosecutions.\n\nJune 1, 2017 - In public remarks, Putin says that hacking may have been carried out by patriotic Russian citizens who felt compelled to respond to perceived slights against Russia from America. Putin says, however, that the Russian government played no role in the cyberattacks. During an interview days later, Putin says that a child could have easily committed the hacking.\n\nJune 5, 2017 - An investigative website, the Intercept posts a report that the Russian government coordinated a spear-phishing attack on computers at an American voting machine company and compromised at least one email account. The article is based on an NSA memo that was leaked to the Intercept. Hours after the story is published, the source of the leak is identified as a government contractor named Reality Leigh Winner, 25. She is charged with transmitting classified information.\n\nJune 21, 2017 - During a Senate hearing, a Department of Homeland Security official says that hackers linked to the Russian government targeted voting systems in up to 21 states.\n\nJuly 25, 2017- A bipartisan bill limiting Trump\u2019s power to ease sanctions against Russia passes in the House by a 419-3 vote. The measure also imposes new sanctions on North Korea and Iran.\n\nJuly 27, 2017 - The Russia sanctions bill passes in the Senate 98-2. White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci tells CNN that the president may veto the bill and negotiate a tougher deal.\n\nJuly 30, 2017 - Putin announces that 755 employees at US diplomatic missions in Russia will be ousted from their posts in response to sanctions.\n\nAugust 2, 2017 - Trump says the Russia sanctions bill is \u201cseriously flawed\u201d but he signs it anyway.\n\nSeptember 6, 2017 - In a blog post, Facebook announces that more than 3,000 advertisements posted on the social network between June 2015 and May 2017 were linked to Russia. The Washington Post reports that the ads came from a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency.\n\nSeptember 22, 2017 - The DHS notifies select states that hackers targeted their election infrastructure before the vote on November 8, 2016. Although vote-counting systems were not impacted, computer networks containing voter info may have been scanned by Russian hackers. Some states reported attempts to infiltrate their computer systems.\n\nOctober 3, 2017 - CNN reports that a number of the Russia-linked Facebook ads were geographically targeted to reach residents of Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump defeated Clinton by a narrow margin in both battleground states.\n\nOctober 12, 2017 - CNN publishes an investigation of Russian trolls who posed as a group of Black Lives Matter activists during the presidential campaign. They used a variety of platforms including Tumblr and Pokemon Go to reach voters.\n\nFebruary 16, 2018 - The Department of Justice announces that Mueller has indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 election, charging them with conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\nJuly 3, 2018 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases a report concluding that the intelligence community\u2019s January 2017 assessment of election meddling was accurate. According to the summary, the intelligence agencies were correct in their finding that the goal of the election interference was to help Trump rather than simply create confusion.\n\nJuly 13, 2018 - The Justice Department announces indictments against 12 members of the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, as part of Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation. The indictment accuses the Russians of engaging in a \u201csustained effort\u201d to hack emails and computer networks associated with the Democratic party during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nJuly 16, 2018 - During a joint press conference with Putin in Helsinki, Trump says that the Russian president was \u201cextremely strong and powerful\u201d in his denial that his country interfered with the 2016 election. Trump says, \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be Russia.\u201d One day later, he clarifies his remark. \u201cThe sentence should have been, \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia,\u2019\u201d Trump says. \u201cSort of a double negative.\u201d\n\nMarch 22, 2019 - Mueller ends his investigation and delivers his report to Attorney General William Barr. A senior Justice Department official tells CNN that there will be no further indictments.\n\nApril 18, 2019 - A redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report is released. The first part of the 448-page document details the evidence gathered by Mueller\u2019s team on coordination and explains his decision not to charge individuals associated with the campaign.\n\nJuly 25, 2019 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases the first installment of its report, entitled \u201cRussian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 Election: Volume 1: Russian Efforts Against Election Infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOctober 8, 2019 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases the second volume of its report on election interference. The report is critical of the FBI for using a contractor to monitor foreign influence operations. \u201cThe apparently outsourced nature of this work is troubling; it suggests FBI either lacked resources or viewed work in this vein as not warranting more institutionalized consideration.\u201d\n\nNovember 2, 2019 - CNN and Buzzfeed begin receiving interview notes from the Mueller investigation, released by court order. It\u2019s revealed that Trump and other top 2016 Trump campaign officials repeatedly privately discussed how the campaign could get access to stolen Democratic emails WikiLeaks had in 2016.\n\nFebruary 6, 2020 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases the third volume of its report on election interference. The committee writes that the Obama administration struggled in its reaction to initial reports of Russia\u2019s actions. Several recommendations are directed to President Trump.\n\nApril 21, 2020 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases the fourth volume of its report on election interference. It includes new details on why the committee backs the US intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help then-candidate Trump. It warns that Russia is likely to try to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\nAugust 18, 2020 - The Senate Intelligence Committee releases the fifth volume of its report on election interference. This report goes beyond the findings Mueller released in 2019, as the Republican-led Senate panel was not limited by questions of criminality that drove the special counsel probe. Among its findings is how Trump and multiple leaders on his campaign spoke with Stone throughout 2016 about reaching out to WikiLeaks and using leaks of Democratic emails to Trump\u2019s advantage.\n\nApril 15, 2021 - President Joe Biden\u2019s administration reveals new details about Russia\u2019s extensive interference in the 2016 and 2020 US elections, including disclosing for the first time that a Russian agent who received internal polling data from the Trump campaign in 2016 passed it along to Russia\u2019s intelligence services.\n\nJuly 28, 2022 - The State Department announces a reward of up to $10 million for knowledge on foreign attempts to interfere in US elections. The department also appeals for information on the Internet Research Agency and other entities and individuals who interfered in the 2016 presidential election.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/26/us/2016-presidential-campaign-hacking-fast-facts/index.html"}, "article2": {"title": "The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk.\n\nHis message was brief, if alarming. At least one computer system belonging to the D.N.C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named \u201cthe Dukes,\u201d a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government.\n\nThe F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government\u2019s best-protected networks.\n\nYared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for \u201cthe Dukes\u201d and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks \u2014 in part because he wasn\u2019t certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html"}, "article3": {"title": "Washington and world await Trump decision today on Paris climate accord", "content": "Boy Scouts: Top leaders didn\u2019t call Trump to praise speech as the president said By Associated Press The Boy Scouts denied Wednesday that the head of the youth organization called President Donald Trump to praise his recent politically aggressive speech to its national jamboree. Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Wednesday, \u201cI got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful.\u201d Politico published the transcript of the interview. \u201cWe are unaware of any such call,\u201d the Boy Scouts responded in a statement. It specified that neither of the organization\u2019s two top leaders \u2014 President Randall Stephenson and Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh \u2014 had placed such a call. The White House had no immediate response to the Boy Scouts\u2019 denial. Surbaugh apologized last week to members of the scouting community who were offended by the political rhetoric in Trump\u2019s July 24 speech in West Virginia. Other U.S. presidents have delivered nonpolitical speeches at past jamborees. To the dismay of many parents and former scouts, Trump promoted his political agenda and derided his rivals, inducing some of the scouts in attendance to boo at the mention of former President Obama. \u201cI want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,\u201d Surbaugh said. \u201cThat was never our intent.\u201d Surbaugh noted that every sitting president since 1937 has been invited to visit the jamboree. Stephenson told the Associated Press two days after the speech that Boy Scout leaders anticipated Trump would spark controversy with politically tinged remarks, yet felt obliged to invite him out of respect for his office. Hoping to minimize friction, the Boy Scouts issued guidelines to adult staff members for how the audience should react to the speech. Any type of political chanting was specifically discouraged. Stephenson, who did not attend Trump\u2019s speech, said the guidance wasn\u2019t followed impeccably.

I don\u2019t think we should be rolling out the carpet to the president of the United States in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,\u201d Khan told Channel 4 news. \u201cWhen you have a special relationship, it is no different to when you have a close mate: You stand with them in times of adversity, but you call them out when they\u2019re wrong. And there are many things about which Donald Trump is wrong.\u201d Trump initially criticized Khan hours after the London attack posting on Twitter: \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d Khan\u2019s office soon pointed out that the president had, in fact, misquoted Khan, who actually said that Londoners should not be alarmed by the increased armed police presence on the streets. Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to slam the London mayor once more. \u201cPathetic excuse by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who had to think fast on his \u2018no reason to be alarmed\u2019 statement. MSM [Mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!\u201d the president wrote. This is not the first time Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital city, has called for Trump\u2019s state visit to be banned. He previously branded Trump\u2019s policies on immigration and proposed travel ban on people entering the U.S. from predominantly Muslim countries \u201ccruel.\u201d An online government petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn also gathered more than 1.8 million votes. The visit was first announced during Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s trip to Washington, where she became the first foreign leader to meet the newly-inaugurated president. State visits are personal invites from the British monarch and involve a significant amount of pomp and ceremony, and usually a state banquet.

He thinks President Trump is even worse. By Mark Z. Barabak (Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times) John Dean is a connoisseur of coverups, a savant of scandal, so he can more than imagine what it\u2019s like inside the Trump White House right now. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said, presiding in a high-backed leather wing chair off the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel.

They don\u2019t know whether to hire lawyers or not, how they\u2019re going to pay for them if they do,\u201d Dean said in a crisp law-counsel cadence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unpleasant place.\u201d Dean was a central figure in Watergate, the 1970s political scandal against which all others are measured, serving at the tender age of 32 as President Nixon\u2019s White House attorney. In that capacity Dean worked to thwart investigators after the clumsy break-in at Democratic Party headquarters, then flipped and helped sink Nixon by revealing the president\u2019s involvement in the coverup.

It didn\u2019t end well By Noam N. Levey Republicans in the state of Washington didn\u2019t wait long in the spring of 1995 to fulfill their pledge to roll back a sweeping law expanding health coverage in the state. Coming off historic electoral gains, the GOP legislators scrapped much of the law while pledging to make health insurance affordable and to free state residents from onerous government mandates. It didn\u2019t work out that way: The repeal left the state\u2019s insurance market in shambles, sent premiums skyrocketing and drove health insurers from the state. It took nearly five years to repair the damage. Two decades later, the ill-fated experiment, largely relegated to academic journals, offers a caution to lawmakers at the national level as Republicans in the U.S. Senate race to write a bill to repeal and replace the federal Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to break something,\u201d said Pam MacEwan, who led a Washington state commission charged with implementing the law in the mid-1990s and now oversees the state insurance market there. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. \u2026 And that\u2019s when people get hurt.\u201d The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office echoed that warning last week, when it concluded that the healthcare bill passed by the House last month would destabilize insurance markets in a sixth of the country and nearly double the number of people without health insurance over the next decade.

Press Secretary Sean Spicer, during an unusually short 11-minute briefing in which he insisted he not be on camera, declined to give any explanation for Trump\u2019s tweet posted just after midnight. Nor would he translate what the president was trying to say in the garbled message that broke off midsentence. But Spicer told reporters that the public should not be concerned that the president sent what the questioner called \u201csomewhat of an incoherent tweet.\u201d \u201cThe president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,\u201d Spicer said.

The organization, which Biden is calling American Possibilities, will be staffed by a former top political aide to the vice president, Greg Schultz, who is also a veteran of President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign. The PAC will allow Biden to raise money that he can use to travel the country, contribute to candidates in governor\u2019s races this year and congressional and state races in 2018 and generally do the sorts of things that aspiring politicians do to keep their names in the headlines. All that can\u2019t help but nurture questions about whether Biden, 74, will try yet again to attain the office he first started running for in 1987. In public appearances, which have taken him to electorally important states, and interviews since the 2016 election, Biden has been sharply critical of the Trump administration, but has also pointed to flaws in his own party. In one interview, he pointed to a \u201cbit of elitism that\u2019s crept in\u201d to the party\u2019s approach to working-class voters. At the same time, he has given carefully ambiguous answers when asked about his plans. At a conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, he responded to the question about a presidential run by saying: \u201cCould I? Yes. Would I? Probably not.\u201d In the announcement for the new group, Biden said that \u201cthe negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics drives me crazy. It\u2019s not who we are.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for big dreams and American possibilities,\u201d he said.

Hunger and violence have pushed Venezuela to the brink of humanitarian disaster, diplomats say. But Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the Organization of American States faced unlikely prospects for success: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro does not trust the organization and has said his nation will withdraw its membership. Some OAS nations, including several U.S. allies in the Caribbean, have criticized the regional body\u2019s efforts as intervention promoted by Washington. But U.S. officials are hoping the sheer weight of the crisis will unite the region to put pressure on Venezuela. \u201cThere\u2019s more and more concern about what we\u2019re seeing, and so more and more countries have gotten over their reluctance to question or go against the wishes of the Venezuelan government,\u201d a senior State Department official said in a briefing for reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to stand by and do nothing in the face of the kinds of institutional steps we\u2019ve seen in Venezuela, and the increasing humanitarian suffering,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, in keeping with frequent administration practice. Although the OAS periodically brings its members\u2019 foreign ministers together, this is the first time a meeting has been convened to deal with a single topic, U.S. officials said. At the conclusion of Wednesday\u2019s session, diplomats said they had discussed two resolutions. One, promoted by Caribbean nations, called on Venezuela to reconsider withdrawing from the OAS. A second more pointed resolution authored by the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Panama and Peru urged the Maduro administration not to go ahead with a constituent assembly that would rewrite the Venezuelan constitution. Many fear it would dissolve the few democratic institutions that remain and favor the ruling Socialist Party. Separately, the Venezuela opposition, emboldened by a string of increasingly massive street demonstrations, sharply criticized Wall Street for extending what it called a \u201clifeline\u201d to the Maduro government. At issue is the purchase by Goldman Sachs of Venezuelan government bonds for a reported $865 million, a major discount for paper originally worth $2.8 billion. Goldman Sachs confirmed the purchase of the bonds, issued in 2014 by the state oil company PDVSA, after it was reported in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe are invested in PDVSA bonds because, like many in the asset management industry, we believe the situation in the country must improve over time,\u201d Goldman said in a statement. The firm added that it made the purchase through a secondary dealer to avoid direct interaction with the Venezuelan government. That distinction meant nothing to the Venezuelan opposition, which accused Goldman of \u201cmaking a buck off the suffering\u201d of the Venezuelan people. The Trump administration previously has targeted the Maduro government, slapping economic sanctions on its vice president and pro-Maduro Supreme Court justices.

Comey met with Robert S. Mueller III, whom the Justice Department appointed on May 17 to investigate any Russian ties to the Trump campaign, and Mueller said he had no problems with Comey\u2019s testifying, the associate said. Trump abruptly fired Comey as head of the FBI on May 9. The president later said in an interview on NBC News that he was concerned about the FBI investigation into what he called the \u201cRussia thing.\u201d Comey reportedly wrote internal memos after his meetings with Trump. In one, he wrote that the president had requested he ease up on the FBI probe of Michael Flynn, who served as Trump\u2019s national security advisor until he was ousted in February for lying about his contacts with Russian officials. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced on May 19 that Comey had agreed to testify after the Memorial Day holiday. The hearing has not been scheduled. The FBI separately declined a request from the House Oversight Committee to turn over Comey\u2019s memos. The bureau said it would need to consult with Mueller before making any decisions. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the committee chairman, said in response that he would not push the matter. \u201cThe focus of the committee\u2019s investigation is the independence of the FBI\u201d and the events leading to Comey\u2019s firing, he wrote. In a separate development, a senior Justice Department lawyer with experience in complex financial fraud investigations has agreed to join Mueller\u2019s investigation. Andrew Weissman has led the fraud section at Justice, where he oversaw probes into corporate wrongdoing at Volkswagen and Takata. Weissman also is a veteran of the FBI. Weissman is the highest-ranking Justice Department official to join the special counsel office being set up a few blocks from the main Justice building in downtown Washington. Mueller also hired two colleagues from the WilmerHale law firm, where he worked, and brought on a former Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, to handle media inquiries.

(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Six months after President Trump breached long-standing political boundaries to win the White House, the nation\u2019s major political parties still muddle in his wake. On the sun-swept lawn of the Hotel del Coronado two weeks ago, national Republican leaders sipped cocktails and listened to San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of the party\u2019s brightest lights in the most populous state, praise a brand of moderate Republicanism that looks nothing like the versions coming out of Washington \u2014 either the populism of the president or the more orthodox conservatism of congressional leaders. A week later, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez talked in a Sacramento interview of the \u201cremarkably constructive\u201d debate underway in his party, characterizing its divisions as largely in the past. Within hours, he and other party leaders were booed as they welcomed delegates to a state convention that would be filled with persistent internal warfare on healthcare and other issues. No political party is immune to disagreement; indeed the path to power often relies on combustible ideological diversity. But Democrats and Republicans alike seem particularly adrift and quarrelsome these days.

A flurry of leaks, counter-leaks and public statements thrust back into the spotlight a decision that has been agonized and untidy even by the standards of a White House known for internal drama. Wednesday morning, when officials told some news organizations that Trump had settled on pulling out of the climate agreement, seemingly everyone in the world jumped in to try to influence or spin his decision, from the Chinese government to the coal industry to the state of California. That offered a foretaste of the reaction Trump likely will receive if he does follow through on his vow to pull the United States out of the 195-nation pact, which President Obama hailed in 2015 as one of his major achievements. Other nations have swiftly moved to take over the leadership role on climate that the United States would be abandoning. Some states have followed suit, promising they would break with Washington to work with other countries in their efforts to contain global warming. During Trump\u2019s recent overseas trip, U.S. allies warned him that America\u2019s broader diplomatic influence would be undercut if the administration gave up its seat at the climate negotiating table. All the public lobbying on Wednesday moved Trump to weigh in himself. He knocked down reports that he had decided to withdraw with a tweet announcing that he was still making up his mind. The mixed messages coming out of the White House left open the possibility that the original news reports reflected the views of officials who were aiming to steer the final outcome by presenting withdrawal as a done deal. Trump\u2019s schedule for the day includes meetings with advisors hoping to talk him into staying in the agreement, at least to some extent. If Trump does withdraw the U.S. fully from the Paris pact, scientists warn it will be a tremendous setback to the worldwide effort to contain temperatures from rising an average of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The consequences for the United States would extend beyond global warming. \u201cIt will be a very big deal all over the world,\u201d said Todd Stern, the lead U.S. climate negotiator during the Obama administration. \u201cThere will be consequential blowback with respect to our diplomatic position across the board.\u201d UPDATES 9:27 a.m.: This post was updated throughout with staff reporting and additional details. 6:23 a.m.: This post was updated with Trump\u2019s tweet. 6:04 a.m.: This post was updated throughout with additional details.

Very bad for U.S. This will change,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. Last week, White House spokespeople had denied that Trump criticized German trade practices after the German newspaper Der Spiegel quoted him as having done so. Trump unsettled Merkel and other allies during the recent NATO summit when, during his remarks, he did not mention the central commitment members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization make to defend each other. We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2017 Trump\u2019s policy toward climate change is another point of contention with many European countries. Trump promised during the election to tear up the landmark Paris climate accord. Merkel said the conversation with the U.S. on climate change last week during the G-7 meetings in Sicily, which followed the NATO summit, was \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d During a campaign speech in Munich on Sunday, Merkel said Germany must rethink how much it can rely on its allies. \u201cThe era in which we could rely completely on others is gone, at least partially,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cI have experienced that over the last several days.\u201d In a 2014 meeting, NATO defense ministers agreed that each state would move toward a goal of raising military spending to 2% of its annual economic output by the year 2024. German defense spending is below that goal. The U.S. trade deficit with Germany shrank to $65 billion in 2016 from $75 billion the year before.

Adam Schiff isn\u2019t sure By Laura King The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), says he\u2019s not sure that President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and advisor, Jared Kushner, should retain his security clearance. The California Democrat, who has been a sharp critic of Trump, also said in an interview aired Sunday that national security advisor H.R. McMaster, a highly respected military officer, had been tarnished by his association with the White House. Schiff\u2019s comments, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d came amid growing questions about Kushner\u2019s contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office. Trump has denounced the latest round of news reports, saying that some of them could be based on fabricated sources. Top Trump aides, including John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, pushed back Sunday against the suggestion that there was anything untoward about establishing \u201cback channel\u201d communications with the Russians during the presidential transition. Schiff said he regretted that McMaster had done so as well, saying he believed the White House \u201cused\u201d the solid reputations of people like him to back up dubious actions. \u201cSadly, I think this is an administration that takes in people with good credibility and chews them out and spits out their credibility at the same time,\u201d said Schiff, who acknowledged that what McMaster said about back channel communications was \u201ctrue in the abstract.\u201d \u201cI think anyone within the Trump orbit is at risk of being used,\u201d he said. Kelly, in separate talk-show appearances on Sunday, said there was nothing untoward about an incoming administration establishing communications with a foreign power in order to lay the groundwork for better relations. Schiff declined to discuss the substance of the allegations regarding Kushner\u2019s contact with Russian officials during the transition and whether Kushner had been forthcoming about them, but said enough questions had been raised that his access to top-secret intelligence should be scrutinized. \u201cI think we need to get to the bottom of these allegations,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut I do think there ought to be a review of his security clearance to find out whether he was truthful, whether he was candid. If not, then there\u2019s no way he can maintain that kind of a clearance.\u201d Schiff was also critical of continuing involvement in aspects of the Russia probe by fellow Californian Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who stepped aside from the probe earlier this year after the House Ethics Committee began investigating whether he had improperly revealed classified information. Nunes remains involved in decision-making about the issuance of subpoenas, Schiff said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he should, given that he has stepped aside or recused himself.\u201d The committee is investigating Russian entanglements by figures in Trump\u2019s circle, including fired national security advisor Michael Flynn, who has been the target of multiple subpoenas.

During a visit to Europe that ended Saturday, Trump dismayed European allies by refusing to commit to remaining in the 2015 accord during talks with European Union officials in Brussels and at the Group of Seven gathering in Sicily. The president said in a tweet that he will make a decision this week. Mattis, who was present at some of the Brussels talks, said that Trump is still making up his mind, and that he has been inquisitive about other leaders\u2019 opinions. \u201cThe president was open \u2013 he was curious about why others were in the position they were in, his counterparts in other nations,\u201d the Defense secretary said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.\u201d During his European trip, Trump met privately at the Vatican with Pope Francis, who presented him with a copy of his papal encyclical on environment and climate change.

Kelly said Sunday. Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Kelly was asked about reports by the Washington Post and other outlets that President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close advisor, Jared Kushner, sought to set up secret lines of communication with Russian officials prior to Trump being sworn in. The retired general did not confirm the reports, but said the principle of establishing secretive contacts during a presidential transition \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me\u201d and is a legitimate means of building relationships. \u201cI think that any channel of communication, back or otherwise, with a country like Russia is a good thing,\u201d he said. Kelly did not address a central element of the reports \u2014 that Kushner discussed the possibility of using Russian communications channels from a Russia diplomatic outpost to shield from U.S. intelligence surveillance whatever discussions Trump transition officials wanted to have with Moscow. The FBI, a special counsel and multiple congressional committees are probing Russian interference in the presidential campaign and whether the Trump camp colluded in it. The U.S. intelligence community says Russian cyberattacks were meant to boost Trump and harm his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In a separate interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Kelly defended the integrity of Kushner, whose involvement in communications with Russia has brought the investigation closer to Trump personally than has previous scrutiny of others in his campaign circle or the White House. Calling Kushner \u201ca great guy, a decent guy,\u201d the Homeland Security secretary said the president\u2019s son-in-law\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 interest, really, is the nation.\u201d Also in the NBC interview, Kelly excoriated intelligence leaks in the wake of last week\u2019s deadly bombing in Manchester, England. British officials including Prime Minister Theresa May were angered by disclosures about details of the investigation, including the release of the dead attacker\u2019s name and detailed photos from the bomb scene that were published by the New York Times. Several outlets cited unnamed U.S. officials as the source of the information including the bomber\u2019s identity. The Times did not say how it obtained the photos. Britain routinely shares intelligence with close allies like the United States with the expectation that it will be kept confidential. Kelly said that failing to keep such secrets could seriously damage intelligence-sharing arrangements with other nations. \u201cI believe when you leak the kind of information that seems to be routinely leaked -\u2014 high, high level of classification\u2026 I think it\u2019s darn close to treason,\u201d Kelly said. It is not clear what level of classification, if any, the information about the British investigation would have had. Trump himself, who recently caused controversy when he passed sensitive intelligence on Islamic State to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discussed the location of U.S. nuclear submarines with the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has denounced the Manchester leaks and vowed to track down the source or sources.

In a Sunday morning series of posts on Twitter, the president repeated his denunciations of the \u201cfake media,\u201d celebrated the Republican victory in a Montana special election and declared his overseas trip a success. Trump returned to the White House late Saturday after a swing through the Middle East and Europe, the first foreign trip of his presidency. During it, he tweeted only sparingly. While Trump was away, controversy continued to swirl around his White House, with media reports focusing on son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s role in Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials. The GOP healthcare plan and Trump\u2019s budget also came under withering scrutiny during the president\u2019s absence. In Sunday\u2019s tweets, Trump said cascading leaks from within his administration were in fact \u201cfabricated lies\u201d by news organizations based on sources that did not exist. One tweet was corrected to fix the spelling of \u201cexist.\u201d It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 Trump also complained that the special congressional election in Montana, called to fill the seat vacated when Ryan Zinke became his Interior secretary, \u201cwas such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won.\u201d The \u201cV was poorly covered,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican victory. The victory by Republican candidate Greg Gianforte received extensive coverage. It was widely expected, given Montana\u2019s significant Republican edge, but made more suspenseful on the eve of the election when Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault for an incident in which he struck a reporter who had asked him a question. The president received mixed reviews for his inaugural overseas venture. He was praised by some for his outreach to Sunni Arab allies in the Persian Gulf, but continued his administration\u2019s practice of making no public criticism of serious human rights violations. In Europe, he rattled allies by declining to explicitly endorse the NATO alliance\u2019s bedrock common defense pledge or pledge to adhere to the Paris climate accord. Whatever the commentary surrounding the trip, Trump counted it a success. \u201cHard work but big results,\u201d he wrote.

While delivering a commencement address at her alma mater, Wellesley College, a private women\u2019s liberal arts school in Massachusetts, Clinton, without naming Trump, recalled how many young people in the 1970s reacted to Nixon\u2019s reelection and later battles with the Justice Department. \u201cWe were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice,\u201d she said, pausing to note she was referring to Nixon. Actually, Nixon was not impeached, though many in Congress, including members of his own party, called for it. Clinton said Nixon\u2019s resignation came after he fired \u201cthe person heading the investigation into him at the Department of Justice.\u201d In 1973, Nixon ordered Justice Department officials to fire a special prosecutor who was looking into taped conversations recorded in the Oval Office as part of the Watergate investigation. A year later, in August 1974, Nixon resigned. Some political observers \u2013 mostly Democrats -- have compared Trump\u2019s recent firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, who was overseeing an investigation of possible collusion between Russians and Trump\u2019s campaign, to Nixon\u2019s actions. Last week, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) called for Trump to be impeached. Clinton, who has made few public appearances since Trump defeated her in last year\u2019s presidential election, also assailed the Republican\u2019s new budget proposal. She called the budget, which proposes cuts to education and Medicaid, \u201can attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us \u2014 the youngest, the oldest, the poorest and hard-working people who need a little help to gain or hang on to a decent, middle-class life.\u201d In a statement, the Republican National Committee said Clinton was \u201clashing out\u201d after her election loss. Clinton graduated from Wellesley in 1969 and last delivered a commencement address at the school in 1992.

Memoli (Sean Gallup / Getty Images) As President Trump met with leaders of the world\u2019s leading economies here Friday within miles of an active volcano, the White House was working to ease a pair of diplomatic eruptions. Trump was due to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of the G-7 Summit in this coastal Sicilian resort town, amid tensions between their countries, longtime allies, following leaks to U.S. media outlets involving Britain\u2019s investigation of the Manchester terrorist bombing. Separately, a top White House adviser partially confirmed reports that Trump had said Germany is \u201cvery bad\u201d during Thursday\u2019s NATO meetings in Brussels, but clarified that the president was referring only to German trade policies. Trump said, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel, \u201cSee the millions of cars they are selling to the U.S.? Terrible. We will stop this.\u201d Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, acknowledged that Trump made the remark but added that the president \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a problem with Germany.\u201d \u201cHe said his dad is from Germany. He said I don\u2019t have a problem with Germany, I have a problem with German trade,\u201d Cohn said.

The summit, and Trump\u2019s eight-day inaugural foreign trip, ends Saturday. Other allies here were likely to press Trump on another issue: climate change, specifically whether Trump will carry out his campaign promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate deal. Trump was hoping to better understand the European position, Cohn said. White House officials have said the president will make a decision once he is back in the United States. \u201cHe knows that in the U.S. there\u2019s very strong opinions on both sides but he also knows that Paris has important meaning to many of the European leaders. And he wants to clearly hear what the European leaders have to say,\u201d Cohn said.

(Martin Meissner / Associated Press) With President Trump balking on his vow to shred the Obama-negotiated Paris agreement on climate change, the last place the pact\u2019s staunch opponents wanted to see the president is where he will be this weekend \u2014 meeting other world leaders unanimous in their warnings that withdrawal from the accord would seriously damage America\u2019s economy and world stature. Trump has repeatedly delayed fulfilling his campaign pledge to move against the agreement. The longer the White House deliberates over Paris, the more Trump seems to be searching for a face-saving excuse to walk back his previous position. The White House indecision over the climate accord \u2014 which has the support of every nation except Syria and Nicaragua \u2014 reflects a deeply divided worldview in a Trump inner circle now packed with establishment Republicans. The issue also presents yet another policy reckoning for Trump. On the campaign trail, he vowed to strike blows against the existing world order. But on the Paris agreement, as on other matters, he is finding that political backup for such pledges can fade quickly when the moves lack robust support from major U.S. companies or majority voting blocs.

Barabak Republican Greg Gianforte overcame a last-minute assault charge to win Montana\u2019s special congressional election Thursday, keeping its lone House seat in GOP hands and dealing Democrats a setback in their bid to gain a red-state toehold ahead of the 2018 midterm election. Gianforte, 56, a wealthy businessman who ran unsuccessfully for governor in November, had long been the front-runner against Democrat Rob Quist, a professional bluegrass musician making his first run for public office. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Gianforte was holding a healthy lead with just over 50% support. Appearing at an exuberant victory rally in Bozeman, the congressman-elect hushed the crowd and apologized to the reporter with whom he tangled on election eve, reversing his campaign\u2019s initial assertion that the journalist was to blame.

Comey\u2019s interactions with the White House and Justice Department, including materials dating back nearly four years to the Obama administration. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported that the FBI is investigating meetings that President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had in December with Russian officials. The FBI and the Oversight Committee \u2014 as well as several other congressional panels \u2014 are looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. Trump fired Comey on May 9 amid questions about the FBI\u2019s investigation, which is now being led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director. Kushner, a key White House advisor, had meetings late last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov. The Post story cited anonymous \u201cpeople familiar with the investigation,\u201d who said the FBI investigation does not mean that Kushner is suspected of a crime. Kushner\u2019s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, released a statement saying: \u201cMr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.\u201d Earlier Thursday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he wants records of Comey\u2019s contacts with the White House and Justice Department dating to September 2013, when Comey was sworn in as FBI director under President Obama. In a letter to McCabe, Chaffetz said he is seeking to review Comey\u2019s memos and other written materials so he can \u201cbetter understand\u201d Comey\u2019s communications with the White House and attorney general\u2019s office.

The ruling is the latest legal setback for Trump on the travel issue and, like several previous court rulings, the outcome rested heavily on his own words. Trump\u2019s order restricting travel from six majority-Muslim countries \u201cspeaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,\u201d Chief Judge Roger L. Gregory of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote in his ruling. Read the 4th Circuit\u2019s decision to uphold the block on Trump\u2019s travel ban The 10-3 ruling included numerous citations to campaign statements in which Trump called for a ban on Muslims immigrating to the United States. The plaintiffs who have challenged the travel order have argued that it is a disguised version of the Muslim ban that he called for during the campaign. Trump\u2019s statements \u201cprovide direct, specific evidence of what motivated both EO-1 and EO-2,\u201d the court said, referring to ther first and second versions of the travel order: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s desire to exclude Muslims from the United States.\u201d The 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., is one of two appeals courts that have recently heard arguments on the travel ban. A similar case is pending before the 9th Circuit, based in San Francisco.

About 70,000 people packed an avenue by Berlin\u2019s landmark Brandenburg Gate on Thursday to hear the two leaders speak, with cheers and chants of \u201cBarack, Barack!\u201d breaking out when the former president took the stage. Without mentioning Trump by name, Obama spoke of the need for universal healthcare and a nuanced approach to immigration in response to security threats. \u201cThis is a new world we live in \u2014 we can\u2019t isolate ourselves,\u201d the former president declared, with Merkel looking on. \u201cWe can\u2019t hide behind a wall.\u201d Obama spoke of this week\u2019s deadly bombing at a pop concert in Manchester, England, saying leaders had to find ways to balance security fears and fundamental rights. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges\u2026 is how do you protect your country and your citizens from the kinds of things that we just saw in Manchester,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how do you do it in a way that is consistent with your values and your ideals?\u201d Making his first European speech since his presidential term ended, Obama told the crowd he had spent the last four months \u201ctrying to catch up with my sleep\u201d and devoting more time to his family. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the work I did as president,\u201d he said to more cheers, adding that he considered healthcare reform a signature achievement. Republicans are now in the midst of trying to dismantle his Affordable Care Act. \u201cMy hope was to get 100% of people healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t quite achieve that, but we were able to get 20 million people healthcare who didn\u2019t have it before.\u201d Obama\u2019s speech was not timed to coincide with Trump\u2019s first visit to Europe as president, aides said. The invitation was extended before Trump\u2019s trip to Brussels \u2014 the fourth leg on multi-stop tour \u2014 was scheduled.

The case of Sessions vs. Binderup puts the new administration in a potentially awkward spot, considering President Trump\u2019s repeated assurances during the campaign that he would protect gun ownership rights under the 2nd Amendment. But the Justice Department under Trump has embraced the same position in this case that was adopted under President Obama: to defend strict enforcement of a long-standing federal law that bars convicted criminals from ever owning a gun, even when their crimes did not involve violence.

Memoli (Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) President Trump used his first NATO meeting to rebuke member nations who fail to meet the trans-Atlantic alliance\u2019s defense spending target, saying American taxpayers unfairly are left to pick up the slack. Speaking at dedication ceremonies for NATO\u2019s new headquarters, Trump noted that the defense budgets of 23 of the 28 members don\u2019t meet a target equal to 2% of each respective nation\u2019s economic output, while the United States has spent more on defense in eight years than the other 27 combined. \u201cMany of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make up for the many years lost.\u201d By his scolding, Trump was directly delivering to NATO allies the criticism that was a staple of his nationalist campaign for president. But his lecture came at an event intended to be celebratory, showcasing unity and resolve for the nearly 70-year-old alliance: the dedication of its shining, glass-enclosed new headquarters in Belgium\u2019s capital. The ceremony also was meant to call attention to the fact that the only time NATO has invoked its collective defense agreement was on behalf of the United States, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Trump stood beside a section of wrenched steel from the downed World Trade Center Towers, a relic NATO calls the \u201cArticle V artifact,\u201d to signify that post-9/11 invocation of the NATO charter\u2019s article holding that an attack on any one member would be considered an attack on all. Speaking to reporters before the president arrived, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged that the alliance had a \u201clong way to go\u201d to meet its goals. \u201cBut it\u2019s much better than it was just two years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that when we decrease defense spending when tensions are going down, as we did after the end of the Cold War, we have to be able to increase defense spending when tensions are going up. And now we see that tensions are going up.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch: Trump lectures NATO leaders on defense spending By L.A.

Some British officials have suggested that U.S. officials are leaking sensitive information to American media outlets about the investigation into the attack. The New York Times posted forensic photographs collected from the scene of the Manchester concert bombing, which upset British officials. Whether the photographs were provided by U.S. officials or came from some other source is not publicly known. Trump avoided questions earlier Thursday about the possible leaks. His statement came just before he was set to address NATO at its new headquarters in a speech considered pivotal to his first trip abroad as president. British Prime Minister Theresa May was expected to confront Trump over the issue when they meet later in the day. May told reporters as she entered the NATO gathering that she would make clear to Trump that intelligence shared between law enforcement agencies \u201cmust remain secure.\u201d \u201cWe have a special relationship with the USA. It\u2019s our deepest defense and security partnership that we have,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course that partnership is built on trust, and part of that trust is knowing that intelligence can be shared confidently, and I will be making clear to President Trump today that intelligence shared between law enforcement agencies must remain secure.\u201d In his statement, Trump said that \u201cthe alleged leaks coming out of government agencies are deeply troubling.\u201d \u201cThese leaks have been going on for a long time, and my Administration will get to the bottom of this.

Separate leaks within his own administration and related to investigations of his campaign ties to Russia have also been a source of anger to Trump.

Memoli (Peter Dejoing / Associated Press) President Trump refused to answer questions Thursday about concerns among key allies on intelligence sharing with the United States, just as he prepares to join many of them here to inaugurate the new NATO headquarters. During a brief photo opportunity at his first meeting with Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s newly elected president, Trump for a second time remained silent as a reporter asked about a potential breakdown in the U.S.-United Kingdom intelligence-sharing relationship. British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to press Trump on the issue when they meet later Thursday, after the New York Times posted forensic photographs collected from the scene of the Manchester concert bombing. The acting U.S. ambassador to Britain told the BBC that the leaks were \u201cdeeply distressing.\u201d Speaking to reporters at the site of a NATO leaders meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also deflected questions about whether the incident has led him to reevaluate his nation\u2019s intelligence-sharing arrangements. \u201cWe will continue to work with all our allies to keep Canadians and all citizens around the world safe,\u201d he said. Ahead of a working lunch with Macron, Trump said terrorism was at the top of the agenda, while also offering his congratulations to the 39-year-old for his \u201ctremendous victory.\u201d \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about it,\u201d he said. In addition to terrorism and the economy, Macron said he planned to discuss climate change and energy. His nation hosted the climate summit that produced the agreement under which countries pledged to reduce their carbon emissions, of which the Trump administration is considering dropping out. Trump also ignored a question about whether former national security advisor Michael Flynn should cooperate with the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Tusk added that while some issues \u201cremain open, like climate and trade,\u201d the leaders agreed \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d on the need to combat terrorism. EU officials were skeptical in advance of Trump\u2019s visit. Their concerns were driven in part by the U.S. leader\u2019s positive stance on Britain\u2019s vote last year to leave the bloc. Trump at the time called it a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d However, he has since spoken of the importance of European unity. European officials are also concerned that the Trump administration might withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming, and turn away from trade arrangements with the EU. Trump\u2019s visit to Brussels marked the fourth leg of his first overseas trip. Before heading into the talks with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, he spoke enthusiastically about his earlier stops in Saudi Arabia and at the Vatican. His ceremonial welcome last week in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Trump told the European officials, was \u201cbeyond anything anyone\u2019s seen.\u201d The Saudis staged elaborate festivities including a traditional sword dance. And the president called his private encounter with Pope Francis on Wednesday \u201cvery impressive.\u201d The president and the pontiff met privately for half an hour, and Francis presented Trump with gifts including a copy of a papal encyclical on climate change. \u201cThe pope was terrific,\u201d Trump said. After the visit to the EU\u2019s sprawling new headquarters, Trump headed to a luncheon with the newly elected French president, Emmanuel Macron. The two men were meeting for the first time. During the French presidential campaign, Trump had praised Macron\u2019s far-right opponent Marine Le Pen for her tough positions on immigration and borders, but he had stopped short of endorsing her.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, anticipating the alliance meetings, told reporters flying with the president to Brussels from Rome, where Trump met Pope Francis earlier Wednesday, that Monday\u2019s attack in Britain \u201cis going to strengthen the resolve in this fight against terrorism.\u201d Tillerson stopped short of predicting that NATO would agree to formally join the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but said it \u201cwould be a really important step\u201d if the alliance did so. The attack, which killed 22 people at a pop concert and was said to be the work of a 22-year-old British man whose family is from Libya, also figured in Trump\u2019s brief meeting with the pope at the Vatican.

By Tracy Wilkinson On his first official trip to the Middle East, President Trump has resoundingly thrown America\u2019s lot in with Sunni Arab states and cast Shiite Iran as a global pariah, even as Iranians reelected a president who has offered to work with the West. During his two days in Riyadh, Trump\u2019s full-throated support for the autocratic monarchies in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, as well as his fierce denunciation of Iran, allowed him to claim an historic new coalition of interests. In the next two days, in Jerusalem, he doubled down and argued that Israel and the Arabs should join forces against Iran and along the way, resolve Israel\u2019s conflict with Palestinians in a grand bargain that has eluded diplomats for decades. But as he departed for Rome on Tuesday, Trump had little to show beyond lofty rhetoric, symbolic visits and a shower of flattery from kings, potentates and a prime minister.

Yellen (Michael Dwyer / Associated Press) Most Federal Reserve monetary policymakers indicated they were ready for another small interest rate hike -- perhaps as soon as next month -- if economic data strengthened as expected following a weak winter, according to an account released Wednesday of their most recent meeting. Fed officials also considered a plan to start reducing the $4.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities and other assets the central bank has purchased since 2008 in an attempt to stimulate the economy. The plan, which they said likely would begin later this year, would involve slowly allowing some of the maturing securities to be cashed in instead of reinvesting the money in new securities, the meeting minutes showed. The goal would be to avoid roiling financial markets and causing interest rates to jump.

By Tom Kington First Lady Melania Trump does not say much in public, but her actions seemed to speak louder than words \u2013 or at least sent tongues wagging \u2013 when she appeared to rebuff the president\u2019s proffered hand as the couple descended from their plane in Rome late Tuesday. As President Trump looked to take her hand on the steps of Air Force One, Melania Trump quickly moved it out of reach, raising it to her head to adjust her hair. That made for two such episodes in two days. She had appeared to brush Trump\u2019s hand away at the airport in Tel Aviv during the previous stop in the president\u2019s foreign tour. Video of that scene, often accompanied by snarky commentary, quickly went viral. Compare that to Melania Trump\u2019s positively hands-on visit on Wednesday to a Rome children\u2019s hospital, Bambino Gesu, following the couple\u2019s visit with Pope Francis. After praying to a statue of the Madonna at the entrance to the hospital, the Catholic first lady smiled cheerfully and chatted to children, posing for selfies and providing a \u201cvery happy, maternal presence,\u201d according to one onlooker. \u201cGreat visiting you! Stay strong and positive! Much love, Melania Trump,\u201d she wrote in the visitors\u2019 book. Staff at the hospital said Melania Trump had been buoyed by her meeting with Pope Francis, and further proof came when photos emerged of the Trumps\u2019 quick visit to the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday. As the president and first lady stood together to admire Michelangelo\u2019s 16th century fresco, the Last Judgment, they held hands.

Wire The House Intelligence Committee is preparing to issue subpoenas to President Trump\u2019s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, according to the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, following the lead of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) said the House subpoenas \u201cwill be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information we need\u201d for the committee\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cI think we need to use whatever compulsory [processes] necessary to get the information that he possesses,\u201d Schiff said. Earlier this week, Flynn\u2019s lawyers said he would refuse separate Senate subpoenas for any records about his former business dealings with Russia, citing his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. The Senate committee then issued separate subpoenas to two of Flynn\u2019s businesses, which the panel said were not entitled to 5th Amendment protections. A federal grand jury in Virginia also has issued subpoenas regarding Flynn\u2019s business dealings with Turkey and Russia, and the newly appointed special counsel investigating the Russia matter, Robert Mueller III, is expected to focus on Flynn\u2019s role as well. Given the criminal investigations, Schiff said the House panel is highly unlikely to grant Flynn\u2019s earlier request, through his lawyers, for immunity in exchange for his testimony. He said the panel would need more information about what Flynn would say and whether the testimony would be truthful. It also would need to ensure that granting immunity wouldn\u2019t affect the special counsel\u2019s ongoing investigation, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not somthinge I think we would entertain until far later, if at all,\u201d said Schiff, a former prosecutor. \u201cCertainly count me as very skeptical that we would get to that point.\u201d Trump forced Flynn to resign as national security advisor in February after news accounts revealed Flynn had misled White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials. Schiff spoke to reporters at a breakfast Wednesday hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.

Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel\u2019s army radio on Wednesday that Israeli officials had carried out an internal \u201cpinpoint correction\u201d after discussing and reviewing the episode. Lieberman did not elaborate, and declined to confirm or deny whether Trump\u2019s remarks had endangered an agent of Israel. But he said his government considered the matter resolved. \u201cEverything that needed to be clarified with the friends in the U.S. was done,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAll of the conclusions we had to draw \u2013 it was all done.\u2019\u2019 The Israeli defense minister\u2019s comments came the day after Trump wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel and the West Bank. When word of Trump\u2019s disclosure to Lavrov emerged in U.S. news reports last week, the defense minister and other Israeli leaders confined themselves to expressing public confidence in the two countries\u2019 intelligence cooperation. Israel did not comment more directly, presumably to avoid embarrassing the U.S. president just before his visit. But Trump himself mentioned the controversy anyway, in an awkward on-camera moment during the trip. With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu biting his lip alongside, Trump volunteered to reporters being hustled out of a news appearance: \u201cJust so you know, I never mentioned the word or name \u2018Israel.\u2019 Never mentioned it during the conversation.\u201d News reports, however, had not said the president mentioned Israel in connection with the intelligence, only that the specificity of his remarks to Lavrov would in all likelihood have allowed the Russians to determine the source. The White House at first denied Trump\u2019s disclosure to Lavrov had occurred as reported, but then the president himself tweeted about it, saying he had the right to share information as he deemed fit.

Memoli \"A very great honor,\" Trump says to the pope when they began their meeting in the pope's private study pic.twitter.com/NGsbsahAyT \u2014 Carol Lee (@carolelee) May 24, 2017 President Trump held a half-hour private meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday, declaring it a \u201cgreat honor\u201d despite their past public dissension. The unconventional Republican and the first Jesuit pontiff made for an unlikely pair in the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Palace, where Catholic leaders have presided or centuries and American presidents have come or decades. Francis was silent as the two sat across one another at the pope\u2019s wooden desk to begin the audience at approximately 8:30 a.m. local time. Exactly a half-hour later, the ringing of a bell signified the end of the private encounter. For the White House, the Vatican stop caps a tour through key sites of the world\u2019s three major religions, following stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel, designed to promote tolerance and a united approach to terrorism. \u201cWhen you put it all together, you\u2019re really showing that this problem of radical extremism is one of the great problems of our time,\u201d a senior Trump aide told reporters Tuesday en route from Israel to Rome, briefing anonymously as is common White House practice. \u201cBy putting everybody together you can really build a coalition and show that it\u2019s not a Muslim problem, it\u2019s not a Jewish problem, it\u2019s not a Catholic problem, it\u2019s not a Christian problem, it really is a world problem.\u201d In an exchange of gifts after their private meeting, Francis offered the president a medal by a Roman artist of an olive, a symbol of peace. \u201cWe can use peace,\u201d Trump responded. Where Trump\u2019s and Francis\u2019 interests may align on peace and combating terrorism, they disagree sharply on issues like immigration and poverty. Like Trump, the Argentine pope has shown a predilection for unscripted comments that have shaken the staid Vatican bureaucracy, as when he criticized candidate Trump\u2019s proposed stricter immigration policies including a border wall as \u201cnot Christian.\u201d Trump fired back, calling the pope\u2019s remarks \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Any animosity was not apparent Wednesday, as a meeting between Francis and a larger U.S. delegation ended. \u201cThank you.

In a statement, the department said the president\u2019s $37.6-billion request for it and for the U.S. Agency for International Development would support \u201ca leaner, more efficient government\u201d in line with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d mantra. If approved by Congress, that would represent a reduction of roughly 30% from the current fiscal year. Nongovernmental agencies that receive State Department support to carry out humanitarian and other work around the globe expressed deep alarm. The State Department statement said its new priorities would include efforts to counter terrorism, support Israel, promote border security and battle transnational crime and the spread of infectious diseases. The statement makes no mention of women-empowerment programs or efforts to fight climate change, issues that rose to prominence under the Obama administration. The proposed budget would allow the United States to \u201cremain engaged\u201d in the United Nations, but officials would seek a \u201cmore fair distribution of the funding burden,\u201d the statement said. And it would eliminate \u201cdirect funding for quasi- and non-governmental organizations that serve niche missions.\u201d The American Jewish World Service, which fights poverty all over the world through 450 local organizations, said much of its work would be jeopardized. \u201cAt a time when poverty, human rights abuses, famines and conflicts are wreaking havoc globally,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Robert Bank, \u201cthe United States must not abdicate its long bipartisan tradition of providing development assistance and diplomatic support to the most vulnerable people around the world.\u201d Mercy Corps, a U.S.-based development and advocacy organization that works in 40 countries, said \u201cgutting development programs\u201d was \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and \u201cabsolutely shameful\u201d and could put millions of lives at risk. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, called the budget \u201ccruel and mean-spirited\u201d and said it would force the United States to abandon \u201cour global role as a champion for freedom, democracy and the rule of law.\u201d \u201cIf President Trump thinks the United States can shrink into a defensive crouch without long-term repercussions, he\u2019s sorely mistaken,\u201d Engel said.

Gen. Jeff Sessions. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) In the first budget proposal under President Trump and Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department is seeking hundreds of millions in new funding to pay for an immigration crackdown on the border and a surge in resources to fight violent crime. Like the Department of Homeland Security budget, which includes billions for expanded immigration detention, more border agents and technology to catch those crossing the border illegally, the Justice Department budget is a reflection of the new get-tough policies promised by Sessions. The budget asks for another 300 federal prosecutors \u2013 230 to focus on violent criminals and gangs, and another 70 to concentrate on filing criminal charges on those crossing the border illegally. The shift in the spending priorities are in line with other policy changes ordered by Sessions, including a renewed focus on seeking stiff mandatory minimum sentences for drugs and other crimes. The $27.7-billion budget seeks 450 new attorneys and support workers for the immigration courts, which are now clogged with a backlog of 560,000 cases. There would also be another $50 million for increased immigration detention, plus 40 new U.S. marshal jobs to help take care of the expected increase in immigrants heading to federal court. With Trump\u2019s immigration initiatives tied up in federal court, the budget seeks another 15 lawyers to handle that litigation, plus 12 more to help handle property acquisition needed for Trump\u2019s promised Southwestern border wall. Violent-crime enforcement would get another $198 million, with the largest amount, $70 million, going toward setting up more anti-violence and gang task forces. Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod J. Rosenstein said more resources are needed because of what he called an \u201calarming increase\u201d in the rates of murder and other violent crimes. The department is also asking for another $40 million for more drug enforcement to combat the opioid epidemic, which he said is spreading \u201chavoc throughout the United States.\u201d Sessions\u2019 new policies should lead to an increase in prison population, so the budget contains funding to fully open a new supermax prison in Thomson, Ill., with room for 1,500 to 2,000 inmates. The department also wants to put more resources behind the FBI\u2019s efforts to counter cyber attacks and to figure out ways around encryption technology, along with another 50 agents to counter foreign intelligence and threats from homegrown terrorists.

Never mind the overly optimistic projections on economic growth. Or that Trump\u2019s tax overhaul has not happened yet. Even allowing for both, economists say Trump\u2019s budget still does not add up. The administration is counting on generating $2.1 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years from better economic growth. But Trump\u2019s budget proposal leaves out the cost, or the revenue lost, from the massive tax cuts. In other words, the economic gains that the administration has said it would use to pay for tax reform is apparently also being counted on to pay for deficit reduction. Some people call that double-counting. \u201cYou can\u2019t use the same money twice,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, a senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates keeping government budgets under control. Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and top economic advisor to President Obama, called it an elementary but \u201cegregious accounting error.\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the proposal did not necessarily mean there was an outright omission or a double-counting. It\u2019s possible that the administration is looking for such strong economic growth to drive significantly extra revenue from payroll taxes, he said, or it could be that Trump officials were using different base lines from which they were drawing their results. But on the face of it, he said, the budget and tax-plan numbers \u201cdon\u2019t seem to match.\u201d The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that Trump\u2019s plan to cut corporate and individual taxes would cost the federal government about $5.5 trillion over 10 years, adding more than $6 trillion to the national debt. Details of Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, however, are still being developed, and it\u2019s possible that the administration is assuming a revenue-neutral tax plan \u2014 although experts say big tax cuts never pay for themselves. On Tuesday, Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget chief, did not provide a direct answer or explanation to questions about double-counting. Instead, he told reporters that \u201cyou have to make assumptions about a budget.\u201d He went on to say that one of the assumptions that was not made was to take into account the uncollected taxes every year, which he said amounted to $486 billion last year. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t assume an additional penny of that being closed as part of our tax reform,\u201d said Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Of the 3% annual economic growth assumption, Mulvaney responded that the Obama administration in its first couple of years had based its budget on growth of 4.5%. In fact, Obama\u2019s first budget proposal as president, in May 2009, assumed economic growth of between 4% and 4.6% for the budget years 2011 to 2013. Since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, the U.S. economy has been growing on average about 2% a year, and the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve and most private economists see the economy advancing at about 2% annually over the next 10 years. Alice Rivlin, a former Fed vice chair and director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, said it\u2019s true that the Obama administration\u2019s growth assumptions proved too optimistic. But she noted that those projections were not unreasonable for that time and period in the economic cycle. Then, there was greater potential for growth with unemployment high and many more people than today available for work. Today, the economy is nearing its eighth year of expansion, and the jobless rate is 4.4%, at or near full employment. With the aging of baby boomers, labor force growth slowing, and lackluster productivity gains, economists see the current moderate growth persisting for the foreseeable future. \u201cThis has been a very long period of growth and we\u2019re at the high end already,\u201d Rivlin said. \u201cIf we are so lucky to have continuous, steady growth, it\u2019s not likely to be at 3% or 4% or 5%.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nWho wins and who loses in Trump\u2019s budget The White House Office of Management and Budget sent Congress the president\u2019s inaugural budget today, projecting spending and revenues over the next 10 years. The fiscal package, which include a partial \u201cskinny budget\u201d from March, reflects President Trump\u2019s priorities for the nation, but lawmakers are sure to reject many of the deep cuts in domestic and foreign affairs programs.

The major candidates and outside groups have sunk more than $8 million into the contest, a huge sum in a state where $250,000 pays for a robust week of television advertising. But for all that money and all the outside interest, the election will turn less on national trends than circumstances close to home: on the personalities and histories of the main contestants, their different campaign styles and, perhaps most of all, on who is regarded as the more authentic Montanan.

Late Monday night, this was the scene at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, after a man with possible ties to Islamic State militants set off a suicide bomb, killing 22 people and, once again, setting in motion a global discourse on how to fight terrorism. President Trump, while visiting Bethlehem, said the attack was committed by \u201cevil losers in life.\u201d Throughout the campaign and early in his presidency, Trump has said defeating the Islamic State is a top priority. (He reiterated that point in a speech Sunday in Saudi Arabia, urging Muslim leaders to plot their own course in combating terrorism.) In recent months, with attacks in Berlin, Paris and London, conservative media have questioned the safety of Europe and warned that the United States could face similar attacks. With the latest attack, some on the right are again homing in on the safety of our allies. Here are some of today\u2019s headlines: 2017 has seen a terror attack attempted in Europe every nine days (Breitbart) The attack in Manchester blankets the home page of the right-wing website. Europe has indeed been the location of high-profile attacks this year. In Paris last month, Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in which a man fired an automatic weapon, killing a police officer. And in March, a man plowed his car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, near the British Parliament in London, and then fatally stabbed a police officer. In all, four people were killed and dozens injured in what police called a terrorist attack. The Breitbart piece is an analysis of different terrorist attacks attempted and carried out in Europe since January. \u201cAttacks and attempted attacks have taken place in Austria, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Germany,\u201d on average every nine days, the piece says.
