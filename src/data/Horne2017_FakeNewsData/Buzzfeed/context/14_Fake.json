Authorities say Horner was found dead last week near Phoenix; he was 38.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told NPR that an autopsy found no signs of foul play and that Horner's family said he had a history of abusing prescription drugs. Evidence at the scene suggests that Horner may have died from an accidental overdose, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe county's Office of the Medical Examiner told NPR that its investigation into Horner's death is open and pending, and thus foul play has not been ruled out.\n\nIn a business now associated with Russia and Macedonia, Horner was a homegrown news fabricator.\n\nHe considered himself a political satirist. \"There's a lot of humor, a lot of comedy in it,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in December.\n\nHe created fake stories for his website National Report that were likely to find a believing audience. In one fake story, The Washington Post reports, he claimed that President Barack Obama used his own money to keep open a \"federally funded\" Muslim culture museum during a government shutdown. Horner was delighted that Fox News reported that story as fact before they backtracked.\n\n\"Is National Report the fake news site, or Fox News?\" he asked the newspaper. \"You decide.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Post after the 2016 election Horner said, \"I think Trump is in the White House because of me.\"\n\n\"His followers don't fact-check anything \u2014 they'll post everything, believe anything,\" he said. \"His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.\"\n\nIt's difficult to gauge whether Horner was as influential as he claimed. But his stories certainly reached wide audiences, often by masquerading as coming from reputable news sources.\n\nHis fake story about Obama invalidating November's election result was shared more than 250,000 times on Facebook, according to the Post. Horner told BuzzFeed that another of his bogus stories, which claimed 20 million Amish people had committed to vote for Trump, turned up in Google News and garnered 750,000 page views in two days.\n\nHorner told the newspaper that he was making $10,000 a month from Google-powered ads on his websites.\n\n\"I hate Trump,\" he said. But he targeted conservatives with his stories because he found it was more profitable.\n\nWhen asked why he would write the stories he did, like peddling the idea that there were paid protesters at Trump rallies, Horner said he assumed someone would fact-check it.\n\n\"I mean that's how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it's false, then they look like idiots,\" he told the Post. \"But Trump supporters \u2014 they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he's in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad].\"\n\n\"I do it to try to educate people,\" Horner claimed in the interview on CNN. \"I see certain things wrong in society that I don't like.\"\n\nFacebook announced last week that it would undertake a number of reforms to guard against interference in elections. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the social network wouldn't be able to catch everything.\n\n\"We don't check what people say before they say it,\" he said. \"And frankly, I don't think our society should want us to.\"\n\nHorner's brother told The Associated Press that there was \"a genius behind a lot of\" his brother's work.\n\n\"I think he just wanted people to just think for themselves,\" said J.J. Horner. \"Read more; get more involved instead of just blindly sharing things.\"", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/27/554050916/paul-horner-fake-news-purveyor-who-claimed-credit-for-trump-s-win-found-dead-at-"}, "article2": {"title": "Notorious fake news writer who claimed credit for Trump\u2019s victory is found dead at 38", "content": "Paul Horner claimed that his fake stories were satire, but also claimed credit for helping put Donald Trump in the White House with them.

His stories have also appeared as news on Google.\n\nIn light of concerns that stories like Horner\u2019s may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, Intersect called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. This transcript has been edited for clarity, length and \u2014 ahem \u2014 bad language.\n\nYou\u2019ve been writing fake news for a while now \u2014 you\u2019re kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I\u2019d call it hoaxing or fake news. You\u2019d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn\u2019t care because they\u2019d already accepted it. It\u2019s real scary. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\n\nYou mentioned Trump, and you\u2019ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that?\n\nMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don\u2019t fact-check anything \u2014 they\u2019ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.\n\nWhy? I mean \u2014 why would you even write that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust \u2019cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that\u2019s just insane. I\u2019ve gone to Trump protests \u2014 trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.\n\nConsider these points before sharing an article on Facebook. It could be fake. (Video: Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nI thought they\u2019d fact-check it, and it\u2019d make them look worse. I mean that\u2019s how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it\u2019s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters \u2014 they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he\u2019s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad].\n\nYou think you personally helped elect Trump?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I did or not. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\n\nEarly on the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nI guess I\u2019m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election \u2014 especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs \u2014 why didn\u2019t you stop? Why keep writing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn\u2019t messing them up as much as I wanted \u2014 but I never thought he\u2019d actually get elected. I didn\u2019t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should\u2019ve seen this coming \u2014 everyone assumed Hillary [Clinton] would just get in. But she didn\u2019t, and Trump is president.\n\nSpeaking of Clinton \u2014 did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson\u2019s, for that matter? (Horner\u2019s Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.)\n\nNo. I hate Trump.\n\nIs that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that \u201cno joke . . . in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it\u2019s the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.\u201d That makes it sound like you\u2019ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, it is. They don\u2019t fact-check.\n\nBut a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right?\n\nIt\u2019s great for anybody who does anything with satire \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t write about now that people won\u2019t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff \u2014 like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line \u2014 and people went along with it!\n\nFacebook and Google recently announced that they\u2019d no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this?\n\nThis whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense \u2014 like, you wouldn\u2019t believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense.\n\nI know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I\u2019ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I\u2019d be okay. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from [advertising on fake news sites] for them to just get rid of it. They\u2019d lose a lot of money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if it did really go away, that would suck. I don\u2019t know what I would do.\n\nThinking about this less selfishly, though \u2014 it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you\u2019re describing are pretty scary.\n\nYeah, I mean \u2014 a lot of the sites people are talking about, they\u2019re just total BS sites. There\u2019s no creativity or purpose behind them. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting rid of them. I don\u2019t like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do \u2014 I spend more time on it. There\u2019s purpose and meaning behind it. I don\u2019t just write fake news just to write it.\n\nSo, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they\u2019re listing, and I\u2019m like \u2014 good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting rid of those sites.\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t get rid of mine, too.\n\nLiked that?
