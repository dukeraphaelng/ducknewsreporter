Rich was fatally shot last July in what police have called a botched robbery, and there is no evidence known publicly to suggest he shared those emails. The Rich family had publicly pleaded with Fox News and others to stop trading in such speculation absent facts.\n\n\"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,\" the Tuesday statement read. \"Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards.\" The Fox News statement did not apologize or specify what went wrong or how it did so, and it did not bear the name of its author. But it promised to continue to investigate the story and provide updates.\n\nFox News star host Sean Hannity, who had pushed the theory relentlessly, said on his radio show that he retracted nothing. He also tweeted the importance of finding out the truth. On television Tuesday night, Hannity said he would no longer talk about the story \"out of respect for the family's wishes \u2014 for now.\"\n\nYet Hannity, a leading President Trump advocate and confidant, did not apologize or say the story was wrong. Instead, he pivoted to assailing the \"destroy-Trump media [and] the Democrats.\"\n\nThe public disclosure of the content of those DNC emails threw Hillary Clinton's campaign into turmoil during the 2016 election and led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC, though they did not contain any extraordinary revelations.\n\nThe embrace of the conspiracy theory around Rich's death by Hannity and others caused similar tumult at Fox News this month, revealing and deepening rifts between its journalists and the opinion side that propels its economic success, according to several people at the network.\n\nThe handling of the story also exposed the tentativeness of the network's leadership after the departure of prominent and longtime executives, including former Chairman Roger Ailes and former Co-President Bill Shine. Rupert Murdoch, whose family controls Fox's parent company, is acting as the network's CEO. (Ailes, who died May 18, had been accused of sexual harassment by many women, and Shine had been accused of enabling or hiding his behavior. Both men denied those charges.)\n\nA version of the Fox News May 16 online story ran on the Fox local station in Washington, D.C., Fox 5, the night before. Journalists and executives within Fox watched with growing alarm as Hannity, the network's fixture at 10 p.m., repeatedly legitimized suspicion that Rich's death was linked to the DNC leaks.\n\nThe claim about Rich's death has also been embraced on the air by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Fox News contributor. As far back as August, Fox host Eric Bolling compared the story to something out of the Showtime spy thriller Homeland and called Rich's killing \"a hit.\"\n\nThe May 16 FoxNews.com report claiming proof of Rich's involvement in the DNC email leaks was used by Trump defenders to deflect growing concerns on Capitol Hill and among current and former intelligence officials about the nature of contacts during the campaign between Trump's circle and figures with ties to Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia.\n\nBreitbart News and the Gateway Pundit were among the other sites that trafficked in the conspiracy theory \u2014 as did the Twitter account for the Russian Embassy in London. Yet the story had a particular Fox imprint: The May 15 Fox 5 report cited as its source a private investigator who worked for the Rich family named Rod Wheeler, who has been a paid Fox News contributor. Wheeler later said he had relied on the statement of a Fox 5 producer who had prepared him for the segment.\n\nAs it happens, Wheeler had been hired not by the Riches but by a conservative Dallas investor named Ed Butowsky on their behalf. Butowksy has appeared periodically as a commentator on Fox News and Fox Business. He had his own personality page on Fox's website until shortly after I publicly pointed that fact out last week.\n\nHannity has told others at the network that Fox needs him more than ever since last month's departure of former star host Bill O'Reilly. (O'Reilly also left after facing sexual harassment charges, which he disputes.)\n\nHannity told viewers Tuesday night that he would stay at Fox News \"as long as they seem to want me\" but cited critics who he said were trying to silence him, such as the liberal advocacy group Media Matters. Hannity called such efforts \"liberal fascism.\"\n\nYet many critics of the story could be found on the right \u2014 even among conservative voices in Murdoch's own vast media holdings.\n\nOn May 21, Seth Mandel, opinion page editor of the Murdoch-owned New York Post, tweeted: \"Why are you doing this to them? Why are you tormenting a grieving family like this? Please, Sean. Please. Stop doing this. Please.\"\n\nNew York Post columnist John Podhoretz wrote in the magazine Commentary, which he edits, that the theory is \"the unwitting catspaw of an authoritarian government in Moscow.\"\n\nPodhoretz continued: \"It should go without saying that defaming a dead man by asserting he was killed for doing something criminal is a great evil.\"\n\nAnd National Review editor Jonah Goldberg, a Fox News contributor, has been a constant thorn in Hannity's side on Twitter over the Rich story. Goldberg is the author of a book whose title is apparently familiar to Hannity: Liberal Fascism.\n\nAiles famously hated to retract any reports, arguing that it showed weakness and simply gave more fodder to the network's critics.\n\nIn the post-Ailes era at Fox News, the news side won this round, even though the retraction was grudging, lacked specificity and did not include an apology. But that victory took a full week \u2014 on a story with major national stakes involving a young man's death.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/05/24/529809256/fox-news-retracts-dnc-staffer-conspiracy-story-but-hannity-keeps-it-alive"}, "article3": {"title": "\u2018Pizzagate\u2019 rumors falsely link death of sex-worker advocate to nonexistent Clinton probe", "content": "Gift Article Share\n\n\u201cMonica Peterson went to the country of Haiti to investigate links between the Clinton Foundation and human trafficking. She is now dead. The website for human trafficking is down for maintenance. Pizzagate is real.\u201d\n\n\u2013comment on Facebook, repeated in some variation thousands of times Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The false election-related conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton known as \u201cpizzagate\u201d led a North Carolina man on Dec. 4 to walk into a Washington pizza shop and open fire. A central part of the conspiracy theory, spread across Facebook, Twitter and other social media, is that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex-trafficking ring from the restaurant\u2019s bathrooms.\n\nThe easy acceptance of the false claim underscores how bogus facts about sex trafficking \u2013 which The Fact Checker has examined extensively \u2014 are so easily spread. Now, in a tragic twist, an off-shoot of pizzagate has conspiracy theorists speculating that Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, was killed because she was investigating links between the Clinton Foundation and sex trafficking in Haiti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Dec. 4, the InfoWars.com website \u2013 run by Alex Jones, a big booster of President-elect Donald Trump \u2013 posted a YouTube video titled \u201cHaiti PIZZAGATE: Death of Child Trafficking Investigator.\u201d It falsely claimed \u201cshe had just begun investigating the correlation regarding the Clinton Foundation\u2019s Caracol Industrial Park Complex and its connection to a human trafficking network when her life was cut short.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonica spent her life challenging false narratives,\u201d said Domina Elle, a Denver-based dominatrix who was a close friend. \u201dTo have her death be the subject of a false narrative is very sad.\u201d\n\nThe Facts\n\nPetersen, 32, passed away on Nov. 13, in Haiti. Claude d\u2019Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver, had employed Petersen until June as a researcher and as his assistant, after which she moved to Haiti. He said she had been teaching at private pre-kindergarten-through-12 school, Union School Haiti, mainly to support herself, and had been exploring setting up a nongovernmental organization in Haiti. He said she committed suicide but the circumstances are not clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Estree said Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a \u201cbrilliant\u201d research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara.\n\nIndeed, Petersen was active in promoting sex-worker rights. Her last interview before her death was for a two-hour podcast, which aired in September, hosted by Chris Sowa titled \u201cFighting the Trafficking Narrative from Alaska to Rhode Island.\u201d\n\nBefore going on a 2015 trip to Haiti, Petersen asked for help locating pro-sex worker organizations. \u201cI am a social anthropologist who wants do solid research on HT, rescuing people is not in my agenda (this is a stupid & imperialist concept),\u201d she posted on a Facebook message board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was a sweetie, an amazing, wonderful girl,\u201d said Elle, an activist in Colorado. \u201cShe really did care about sex-worker rights,\u201d eager to do battle against anti-trafficking advocates such as Swanee Hunt, who want to end the sex trade entirely.\n\nSo how did her tragic death spawn a web of conspiracy theories that she was an anti-trafficking investigator?\n\nAn acquaintance named Bella Robinson, a sex worker and activist in Rhode Island, in January had posted a blog post that Petersen had shared on Facebook that had been critical of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s work in Haiti. Shortly after Petersen\u2019s death, the blog post appeared in a Reddit discussion thread. This then resulted in a flurry of \u201cnews stories\u201d falsely claiming that Petersen had written the blog post and was killed for investigating the Clintons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome guy from Reditt found an old Facebook post on the Clintons and screen shot it and tagged it in to this, and even after I confirmed that her death had nothing to do with the Clintons, he made up stories that the family couldn\u2019t get answers,\u201d Robinson wrote The Fact Checker in a Twitter message.\n\nBut others say Robinson, in some fashion, helped fan the flames. Elle said she was shocked to find private comments she had made in an email to Robinson on Nov. 15 about the death apparently cut and pasted into Twitter feeds a day later.\n\nRobinson said her comments were taken out of context, and that she actually was trying to end the speculation. She said that more than 100 people contacted her looking for gossip on Petersen. \u201cDozens of people are putting this fake story on blogs and even making youtubes and they keep doing it even after I confirm her death had nothing to do with a conspiracy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMonica Petersen\u2019s death is a PRIVATE family matter and it had nothing to do with the Clinton scandal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn any case, what would have once been private gossip among friends was suddenly an international sensation, with increasing misinformation and misinterpretation. The blog post Petersen shared months ago with Robinson, for instance, morphed into a blog post she allegedly wrote herself about the Clintons. (Chantal Laurent, who writes \u201cThe Haitian Blogger,\u201d confirmed Petersen never contributed to the blog. \u201cI never heard of her until I read the Reddit article,\u201d she said.)\n\nPetersen\u2019s grieving family was hounded as #MonicaPetersen started trending and her name was added to a list of people allegedly murdered by the Clintons over the years. A faux investigator showed up at the University of Denver memorial service, asking questions and taking photographs. A comment made by d\u2019Estree at the memorial service \u2013 that Petersen \u201cdecided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking\u201d \u2013 was interpreted as referring to Clinton when in fact he was talking about Siddarth Kara. Suddenly, the non-existent investigation was supposedly confirmed. Efforts to correct the record often were dismissed.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that gossip that is false became viral,\u201d Elle said. \u201cIt made me question some of the things I have read that I thought were true.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nAn unexpected death is always heartbreaking. But to have a private matter become the subject of feverish speculation across the Internet is obscene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonica Petersen was an advocate for sex workers who disdained the rhetoric of people she considered anti-trafficking zealots. Yet some people are so quick to promote and share false narratives that they tragically turned her professional focus into the polar opposite \u2013 an investigator of a nonexistent sex trafficking ring involving Hillary Clinton in Haiti.\n\nPlease, quit sharing this nonsense on social media and let her family and friends have some peace.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\n\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/"}}
