Is that true and is that considered common knowledge or a government secret?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nDuring the third and final presidential debate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton warned that her opponent, Donald Trump, cannot be trusted \u201cto have his finger on the nuclear button.\u201d To make her point, Clinton said that it takes \u201cabout four minutes\u201d for the U.S. to launch a nuclear weapon after a president\u2019s order is issued.\n\nClinton, Oct. 19: The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There\u2019s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that\u2019s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.\n\nHer response triggered a debate over whether she divulged state secrets. She didn\u2019t. In fact, there has been a public debate for decades, since the end of the Cold War, about taking ground-based U.S. and Russian nuclear missiles off \u201chigh alert\u201d to prevent an accidental or unauthorized launch \u2014 precisely because of the short time needed to launch an attack.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Strategic Command \u2014 which maintains the readiness of the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u2014 declined to confirm that it takes just four or five minutes to launch a nuclear missile after the president issues the order. When we asked, we were told: \u201c\u2018We do not disclose operational timelines.\u201d\n\nNuclear Weapons on High Alert\n\nThe fact that Russia and the United States have land-based nuclear weapons capable of being launched within minutes of a president\u2019s order is hardly news. The high level of alert \u2014 sometimes called \u201chair-trigger alert\u201d \u2014 is a remnant of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, when both sides armed themselves to counter a nuclear attack on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nThe Minuteman, in fact, is named after its ability to launch quickly when on high alert. \u201cFrom the time keys were turned to execute a positive launch command, until the missile left the silo, only took about a minute. Hence the name Minuteman,\u201d the National Park Service says.\n\n\u201cDe-alerting\u201d \u2014 that is, taking nuclear missiles off high alert \u2014 is something that arms-control experts have been advocating for decades.\n\nIn 1997, three nuclear arms experts wrote an article for Scientific American that made the case \u201cto end the practice of keeping nuclear missiles constantly ready to fire.\u201d The article, \u201cTaking Nuclear Weapons off Hair-Trigger Alert,\u201d cited a 1995 incident in which Russian President Boris Yeltsin had just minutes to determine if a \u201cmysterious rocket\u201d fired from off the coast of Norway was a U.S. nuclear attack on Russia. It turned out to be a false alarm, but it was the first time that the \u201cnuclear briefcase\u201d was activated, and it illustrated the dangers of Russia and the U.S. being on high alert, the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cAlthough international relations have changed drastically since the end of the cold war, both Russia and the U.S. continue to keep the bulk of their nuclear missiles on high-level alert,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cSo within just a few minutes of receiving instructions to fire, a large fraction of the U.S. and Russian land-based rockets (which are armed with about 2,000 and 3,500 warheads, respectively) could begin their 25-minute flights over the North Pole to their wartime targets.\u201d\n\nThe article included a \u201ctimeline for catastrophe\u201d that showed the launch of land-based nuclear missiles just five minutes after a U.S. president issues an order.\n\nOne of the authors of that article, Bruce G. Blair, was a U.S. Air Force Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile launch control officer who is now a professor at Princeton University\u2019s Program on Science and Global Security. In September, Bloomberg Politics consulted with Blair on a graphic illustration of the step-by-step nuclear launch process that is similar to what the Scientific American article described nearly 20 years ago for land- and sea-based missiles.\n\n\u201cAbout five minutes may elapse from the president\u2019s decision until intercontinental ballistic missiles blast out of their silos, and about fifteen minutes until submarine missiles shoot out of their tubes,\u201d Bloomberg Politics wrote.\n\nWe found several instances of similar language used by other nuclear-arms experts.\n\nA 2013 report by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research said that ICBMs are \u201ccapable of launching within five minutes\u201d of a president\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the United States deploys approximately 920 warheads on alert, split almost evenly between intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs),\u201d the U.N. report said. \u201cYet the two legs of the US alert nuclear forces are postured very differently. Of the ICBM force, nearly all (98%) of the 450 missiles are on high alert at any given time, capable of launching within five minutes of the president issuing the launch codes.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 report, the Union of Concerned Scientists also said that the ICBMs \u201ccan be launched within a couple minutes of a presidential decision to do so,\u201d and the submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) can be launched \u201cwithin 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nSo, Clinton was talking about land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles when she said that nuclear weapons can be launched \u201cabout four minutes\u201d after a president\u2019s order is issued.\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, was a co-author of the U.N. report. He told us in an email, \u201cI don\u2019t have access to classified information so my assessment and writings are entirely based on public material and conversations.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cwhat Clinton said appears to reflect what has been said in public for years by various experts and analysts.\u201d\n\nWhile that seems abundantly clear, it still doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether what Clinton said was classified.\n\nFox News quoted military experts after the third debate saying the length of time it takes to launch a nuclear attack is classified information and that the former secretary of state has now confirmed what the media and academics have written.\n\nThe Washington Post in 2007 also reported that nuclear launch times are classified, citing an unnamed \u201csenior U.S. official\u201d in the Bush administration. The Post article was about a statement made by Christina Rocca, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, who told U.N. delegates that \u201cU.S. nuclear forces are not and have never been on hair-trigger alert\u201d \u2013 which arms-control experts described then and now as inaccurate.\n\nWashington Post, Nov. 1, 2007: A senior U.S. official said the claim that thousands of U.S. nuclear weapons can be launched within minutes is incorrect, but added that the information on launch time is classified. \u201cThe idea we are on Cuban-missile-crisis posture, sitting on the silo ready to push the button, is false,\u201d said the official, who was unauthorized to speak publicly. \u201cThe essence of deterrence strategy is having some element of ambiguity.\u201d\n\nWe sent an email to the U.S. Strategic Command and asked if it could confirm that intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of being launched within five minutes of a president\u2019s order, as stated in the U.N. report. Initially, we did not get a response, so we called and spoke to a woman in the U.S. Strategic Command media office who told us, \u201cWe would not give out security information such as the length of time.\u201d\n\nA short time later, we got an official response from the Strategic Command. \u201cI would refer you to the reported comments of our chief spokesperson, U.S. Navy Capt. Brook DeWalt: \u2018We do not disclose operational timelines, but we do work to provide the President as much decision space as possible.'\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us that the information on the short time for a nuclear launch came from Clinton\u2019s debate prep material, which was gathered from publicly available information \u2014 not from classified briefings. But Clinton did have access to such information as secretary of state.\n\nObama Administration Rejects \u2018De-Alerting\u2019\n\nAs secretary of state in the Obama administration, Clinton was involved in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, which among other things considered whether to take land- and sea-based nuclear missiles off high alert. \u201cDe-alerting,\u201d as it is known, would increase the amount of time needed to prepare the missiles for launch and, arms-control experts argue, would reduce the possibility of accidental launches.\n\nBut in an NPR report issued in April 2010, the Defense Department rejected \u201cde-alerting\u201d \u2014 concluding that it could escalate a crisis as both sides race to \u201cre-alert\u201d their missiles.\n\n\u201cThe NPR considered the possibility of reducing alert rates for ICBMs and at-sea rates of SSBNs [strategic ballistic missile nuclear submarines], and concluded that such steps could reduce crisis stability by giving an adversary the incentive to attack before \u2018re-alerting\u2019 was complete,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn making that decision, Obama was breaking a promise he made during the 2008 election, said Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nDuring his 2008 campaign for president, then-Sen. Obama criticized President George W. Bush for breaking a promise made in the 2000 Republican platform, which said the U.S. should \u201cremove as many weapons as possible from high-alert, hair-trigger status.\u201d Obama vowed to keep the promise that Bush had broken.\n\n\u201cFinally, if we want the world to deemphasize the role of nuclear weapons, the United States and Russia must lead by example,\u201d Obama said in an April 23, 2007, speech in Chicago. \u201cPresident Bush once said, \u2018The United States should remove as many weapons as possible from high-alert, hair-trigger status \u2014 another unnecessary vestige of Cold War confrontation.\u2019 Six years later, President Bush has not acted on this promise. I will. We cannot and should not accept the threat of accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch. We can maintain a strong nuclear deterrent to protect our security without rushing to produce a new generation of warheads.\u201d\n\nKristensen told us in an email that Obama quickly \u201cabandoned\u201d that campaign promise.\n\n\u201cThe de-alerting goal was present on the White House website for the first few months of 2009 as part of the new administration\u2019s policy. But it disappeared in the spring of 2009 around the New Prague speech,\u201d Kristensen wrote, referring to an April 5, 2009, speech in which Obama called for a world without nuclear weapons. \u201cSince then, the Obama administration has not only abandoned that part of its policy but also argued forcefully against it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Obama administration has even rejected the use of the term \u201chair-trigger\u201d that Obama used during the 2008 campaign. A 2015 State Department fact sheet argued that U.S. nuclear forces \u201care not on hair-trigger alert,\u201d calling the term inaccurate \u2014 just as the \u201csenior U.S. official\u201d in the Bush administration had done in 2007, as we noted earlier.\n\n\u201cA hair trigger is deliberately calibrated to fire a weapon with only the slightest pressure applied to the trigger. This is not an accurate description of U.S. nuclear forces,\u201d the fact sheet says. \u201cU.S. \u2018alert\u2019 posture simply means a portion of our forces (those on \u2018alert\u2019) are ready to launch upon receipt of an authenticated, encrypted, and securely transmitted order from the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nKristensen said, \u201cThe administration\u2019s attempt to describe alert as different than \u2018hair-trigger\u2019 seems more like an attempt to [put] a human face on the uncomfortable fact that the administration has gone back on its word.\u201d\n\nTo recap: The U.S. Strategic Command does not disclose nuclear launch timelines, and Clinton was in position to know the launch times as secretary of state in the Obama administration.\n\nBut it is common knowledge that it takes about four or five minutes, and other presidential nominees \u2014 including the last two presidents \u2014 have campaigned on the need to take nuclear weapons off \u201chair-trigger status,\u201d a reference to the short time that it takes for the U.S. to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles after the president issues an order.\n\nSources\n\n\u201cFinal Presidential Debate at UNLV.\u201d Transcript.

These priorities led to the U.S. tolerating election irregularities, and doing little to oppose Yeltsin as he empowered oligarchs and installed Vladimir Putin as his successor, among other consequences.\n\nThe new records confirm the Bill-Boris camaraderie was genuine but also masked a complex relationship and ultimately an uneven partnership that reflected the diametrically opposite political and economic trajectories of their two nations in the 1990s.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Clinton-Yeltsin Relationship in Their Own Words\n\nBy Svetlana Savranskaya and Mary Sarotte\n\nIn July 2018, students of U.S.-Russian relations added hundreds of pages of declassified documents to their required reading list when the Clinton Presidential Library released almost all memoranda of Clinton-Yeltsin conversations in response to requests by historian Mary Sarotte in 2015. Today the National Security Archive publishes the highlights of this release.\n\nThe partnership between the United States and Russia that Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin tried to build in the 1990s succeeded only in part \u2013 but even that partial success helped to make the world a safer place. Cooperation on non-proliferation efforts, particularly within the framework of the Nunn-Lugar program, led to the successful withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and above all Ukraine (briefly the third-largest nuclear power in the world due to the amount of Soviet-era weaponry on its territory).[2] The Clinton-Yeltsin cooperation also enabled the safe dismantlement and storage of nuclear weapons in Russia as it complied with the START I treaty. Russia even participated in the international peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, became a member of the G-8, and joined the Council of Europe. In return, the Clinton administration provided badly needed economic assistance and used its leverage with international financial institutions to help Russia.\n\nHowever, many contentious issues damaged the partnership along the way \u2013 most importantly NATO expansion and the military campaign in Kosovo. And, behind the rhetoric of equality and friendship lay the undeniable reality of an enormous power and status disparity. Russia was no longer the superpower that had challenged the United States at the height of the Cold War, and it was not even the declining-but-democratizing Soviet Union of Mikhail Gorbachev. Moscow often felt disrespected, and claimed that its interests and priorities were not being duly considered. For its part, the United States was willing to cooperate only \u2013 in Strobe Talbott\u2019s words \u2013 on \u201cwhat we deem to be [Russia\u2019s] legitimate security concerns,\u201d not on everything the Russians claimed to be important.[3]\n\nIn order to learn more about this crucial era, many years ago the Archive began spearheading an effort to get specific relevant documents declassified. In the summer of 2012, files began trickling in, first from the State Department and then from the Clinton Library, largely in response to itemized requests for specific summit meeting materials made by Archive staff (Svetlana Savranskaya and Tom Blanton) as well as by James Goldgeier with the assistance of Catherine Nielsen. These initial, limited declassifications gave us an important first glimpse behind the scenes of Clinton-Yeltsin conversations, including at the Cologne summit of 1999. Another group of requests produced two particularly significant Clinton-Yeltsin conversations, in Moscow and Halifax in 1995, at the crucial point just before both men\u2019s make-or-break reelection bids of 1996.[4]\n\nStarting in the spring of 2015, Mary Sarotte decided to invest time in a broad-brush approach. She began a three-year process of compiling and filing omnibus requests to the Clinton Library and, when those did not succeed, pursued numerous appeals with the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel or ISCAP.[5] She finally won some of those appeals in 2018, and the Clinton Library declassified a phenomenal set of memcons and telcons as a result. Even better, the Clinton Library declassified nearly all of the pages of her massive requests with no redactions. It therefore becomes possible to read almost the entire history of top-level U.S.-Russian interactions in the contemporaneous words of Clinton and Yeltsin in one (admittedly very long) sitting. Two archivists at the Clinton Library who worked closely with the Archive and Sarotte over the years \u2013 Rob Seibert and Kelly Hendren \u2013 along with Meredith Wagner of ISCAP deserve enormous credit for their hard work, which has provided students of history and diplomacy with a major scholarly opportunity.\n\nWhat do these new sources tell us? The selection of documents below, chosen both from the earlier requests and the 2018 Sarotte release, sheds new light on the most important issues in U.S.-Russian relations in the 1990s. They show Clinton as an empathetic and committed champion of the new Russia, willing to use his political capital to help his friend Boris in tough times, such as during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, or the close-run presidential election of 1996. However, the documents show that Clinton understood the need to balance his relationship with Yeltsin against other priorities of US foreign policy. While Clinton\u2019s stated top goal was to help Russia become a democratic country \u2013 one fully integrated into the Western institutions \u2013 that goal often clashed with other U.S. interests. These interests included: expanding NATO to secure its presence and role in Europe and to expand democracy and security to East-Central Europe; denuclearizing the former Soviet space and making sure that Russian weapons of mass destruction were securely dismantled; limiting Russia\u2019s role in its \u201cnear abroad\u201d; stopping Russian trade in nuclear technologies with Iran and India; and managing conflict in the former republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nClinton saw Yeltsin personally as an indispensable partner in achieving his goals. Only Yeltsin\u2019s continued leadership, the White House believed, could guarantee Russian cooperation on U.S. priorities. The perception of Yeltsin as irreplaceable gradually led to the difficult situation where U.S. backing for the Russian democratic transition consisted largely of promoting its favorite \u201cdemocrat,\u201d Yeltsin, as the only game in town \u2013 even as he was quickly becoming an autocrat in reality. For his part, Yeltsin painted his opponents in the 1996 elections as the ultimate evil: unreformed communists who would attempt to reinstate Stalinism, and take back not only Crimea but also Alaska. The newly available documents show that, in response, Clinton took many steps to increase the chances that Yeltsin would win the Russian elections of 1996, including making presidential visits, delaying visible progress on NATO expansion, and pressing Congress and international financial institutions to provide Russia with loans that would allow Yeltsin to pay salaries and pensions during the critical campaign period. For his part, Yeltsin openly asked his friend to provide $2.5 billion and complained that he only received $300 million of IMF loans.\n\nTo ensure that Yeltsin survived, Clinton was willing to close his eyes to electoral irregularities, the rise of the oligarchs, the war in Chechnya, and the rising corruption in the new Russia. The administration\u2019s policy essentially supported Russia\u2019s economic liberalization as it developed into a form of robber-baron capitalism, or \u201cmarket Bolshevism,\u201d rather than developing into genuine democratic institutions and practices.[6] Put bluntly, Russian stability and the implementation of the flawed market reform turned out to be more important in practical terms than the healthy development of Russian democracy. Tellingly, when Yeltsin reveals to Clinton in the fall of 1999 that he has chosen a successor \u2013 former KGB officer Vladimir Putin \u2013 and will do everything possible to get Putin elected as the next president of Russia, Clinton seemingly accepts Yeltsin\u2019s choice as another one of the measures needed to guarantee Russian stability.\n\nOverall, the documents reveal the complexities of the Clinton-Yeltsin relationship. At once very warm and personal, but at times confrontational and contentious, the sources show an unequal partnership that was neither fully genuine nor fully instrumental but somewhere between the two. On the one hand, Yeltsin tried to play up the personal connection that the two fellow presidents had made, suggesting correctly that they were able to overcome many controversial issues through their personal regard for each other. And there is no doubt that their closeness certainly helped Yeltsin in his domestic political struggles. On the other hand, the sources show that their dialogue was carried out essentially on American terms, with Clinton making suggestions and proposals and Yeltsin often accepting, even when he initially objected. In response to arm-twisting by Clinton, Yeltsin would often accede and respond simply, \u201cI understand.\u201d[7]\n\nThis is not to say that Yeltsin was passive; he made significant proposals of his own, such as on European security structures, cuts to armaments, and even on getting rid of the \u201cnuclear football\u201d (the briefcase that always accompanied both leaders, allowing them to launch nuclear attacks at any time).[8] Yeltsin genuinely tried to promote Russian interests. But he was doing so at a time when, simultaneously, Russia fell into steep economic and political decline and the U.S. rose to the heights of its \u201cunipolar moment.\u201d The interactions of these two world leaders at this crucial juncture \u2013 revealed in the documents below \u2013 have a legacy that shapes U.S.-Russian relations to this day.\n\nRead the documents", "url": "https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2018-10-02/clinton-yeltsin-relationship-their-own-words"}}
