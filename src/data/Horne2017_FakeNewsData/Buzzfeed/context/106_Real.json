Bush appeared in a new ad praising his brother as having \u201ca good heart and a strong backbone,\u201d Jeb Bush sat with his mother for an interview with CBS show \u201cThis Morning.\u201d\n\nThe two attacked Trump as misogynistic and vulgar after he used a four-letter word in a recent campaign appearance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a president would have ever shouted profanities in a speech in front of thousands of people with kids in the crowd,\u201d Jeb Bush said. \u201cHe does it all the time.\u201d\n\nHis mother lambasted Trump for criticizing Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after she quizzed him at a Republican debate in August. Trump made comments widely interpreted as referring to her menstrual cycle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly,\u201d Mrs. Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. And we knew what he meant, too.\u201d\n\nU.S. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush waits to speak at a campaign event at the Greasewood Flats Ranch in Carroll, Iowa January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking\n\nMuch loved by today\u2019s Republicans, the former first lady herself raised eyebrows in 1984 when she reportedly made a derogatory reference to Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman on a major party ticket, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t say it, but it rhymes with rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cALMOST TOO POLITE\u201d\n\nTrump has dismissed Jeb Bush as a \u201clow-energy\u201d loser. The son and brother of U.S. presidents who was expected to glide to the Republican nomination, Bush trails in the single digits in many national polls.\n\nMrs. Bush, who was campaigning for her younger son in New Hampshire, said \u201cAmerica needs\u201d Jeb and drew an implicit contrast to the brash swagger of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s got the same values that America seems to have lost. He\u2019s almost too polite.\u201d\n\nWhile rivals took aim at him, Trump was forced to miss a rally on Friday in Londonderry, New Hampshire because of a snow storm and was stuck in New York, a spokesman said.\n\nTrump has eschewed much of the one-on-one retail politicking of typical campaigns in favor of large rallies. But in New Hampshire, where voters are used to having candidates\u2019 close attention, the strategy could hurt.\n\nJeb Bush seized the opportunity to make fun of Trump on Twitter, pointing out that even his mother was able make it out despite the weather.\n\n\u201cMy 90 year old mother made it out to campaign,\u201d he wrote in response to Trump\u2019s tweet that he was moving a campaign event to Monday due to a \u201cbig storm.\u201d\n\nThe Bushes chatted with people at a diner in Derry, New Hampshire, according to a pool report sent to news outlets. \u201cVote for my boy,\u201d Barbara Bush told one table. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen snow in 1,000 years,\u201d she said.\n\nThe snow did not stop Ohio Governor John Kasich either. His campaign sent reporters a video of the candidate in a snowball fight after a town hall.\n\nJeb Bush also stepped up attacks on Rubio as lacking in experience and accomplishments, saying on MSNBC the first-term Florida lawmaker had done \u201cnothing\u201d in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe was not the only one piling on Rubio. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie released satirical videos slamming the Floridian as \u201cscripted\u201d for repeating himself in interviews and speeches.\n\nAnd the New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper\u2019s publisher criticized Rubio in an editorial for presenting himself as a Washington outsider, saying Rubio \u201cmust think New Hampshire a bunch of rubes.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side for Rubio, he picked up the endorsement of former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who dropped out of the Republican race in November.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a principled conservative. I think he\u2019s the right guy to lead us forward,\u201d Jindal said on Fox News.\n\nA Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released on Friday found that about one-third of likely Republican voters said they could still change their minds.\n\nThe poll showed Rubio with 19 percent, behind Trump\u2019s 29 percent. Kasich came in third with 13 percent, followed by Bush and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nFor the Democrats, opinion polls show U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont with a double-digit lead in New Hampshire over rival Hillary Clinton.

After Donald Trump\u2019s Remarks on Megyn Kelly", "content": "Donald J. Trump\u2019s suggestion that a Fox News journalist had questioned him forcefully at the Republican presidential debate because she was menstruating cost him a speaking slot Saturday night at an influential gathering of conservatives in Atlanta. It also raised new questions about how much longer Republican Party leaders would have to contend with Mr. Trump\u2019s disruptive presence in the primary field.\n\nContinuing his complaints about Megyn Kelly, one of the moderators of the debate, in an interview on CNN Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The remark prompted Erick Erickson, the leader of RedState, the conservative group, to disinvite him.\n\n\u201cIf your standard-bearer has to resort to that,\u201d Mr. Erickson told hundreds of conservative activists in a packed Atlanta hotel ballroom on Saturday, \u201cwe need a new standard-bearer.\u201d\n\nWith Mr. Trump at center stage Thursday in Cleveland, Fox News shattered television viewership records for a primary debate: Nearly 24 million people watched. But any hopes that Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and television celebrity, would try to reinvent himself as a sober-minded statesman, or that he would collapse under scrutiny and tough questions, vaporized in the opening minutes when he refused to rule out running as an independent candidate for president. His remarks Friday only furthered the impression that he also had no intention of speaking more carefully. Mr. Trump denied on Saturday that he had been implying that Ms. Kelly was menstruating. \u201cI think only a degenerate would think that I would have meant that,\u201d he said in an interview, insisting that he had been referring to Ms. Kelly\u2019s nose and ears.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/politics/donald-trump-disinvited-from-conservative-event-over-remark-on-megyn-kelly.html"}}
