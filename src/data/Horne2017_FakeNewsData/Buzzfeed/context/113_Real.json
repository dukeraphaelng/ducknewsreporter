{"foreign_id": "113_Real", "article1": {"title": "April 4, 2023 Trump indictment news", "content": "Former President Donald Trump applauds at an event at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday. (Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday night after he was arraigned in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records \u2014 and delivered a barrage of false claims that have been previously debunked.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all the charges Tuesday.\n\nThe former president was repeatedly inaccurate when he pivoted to the subject of the federal investigation into his handling of official governments. He also repeated some of his favorite falsehoods on a variety of other subjects.\n\nHere is a fact check of some of Trump's claims:\n\nGeorge Soros and the district attorney: As he has on social media in the last month, Trump invoked liberal billionaire donor George Soros while criticizing District Attorney Alvin Bragg in his speech on Tuesday night \u2014 claiming that Bragg is a \"radical left, George Soros-backed prosecutor.\"\n\nFacts First: This needs context. Soros did not make any donations to Bragg's 2021 election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN that the two men have never once communicated in any way; there is no evidence that Soros had any role in Bragg's decision to prosecute Trump. However, Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic district attorney candidates who favor criminal justice reform, did support Bragg's election campaign indirectly: he was a major donor to a liberal political action committee, Color of Change PAC, that says it spent just over $500,000 on an independent expenditure effort in support of Bragg's candidacy.\n\nVachon told CNN: \"Between 2016 and 2022, George Soros personally and Democracy PAC (a PAC to which Mr. Soros has contributed funds) have together contributed roughly $4 million to Color of Change's PAC, including $1 million in May 2021. None of those funds were earmarked for Alvin Bragg's campaign. George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never meet in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom etc. There has been no contact between the two.\"\n\nFormer presidents' handling of documents after leaving the White House: Defending his handling of government documents, which is the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, Trump repeated his false claim that that several other former presidents took documents with them upon leaving the White House.\n\nTrump claimed in his Tuesday speech that \"openly taking boxes of documents and mostly clothing and other things to my home\" is something \"which President Obama has done.\" He continued, \"The Bushes have done. Jimmy Carter's done. Ronald Reagan is done. Everybody's done.\"\n\nFacts First: This is false, as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) itself pointed out in a statement last year; there is no evidence that previous presidents did anything like what Trump did after the Presidential Records Act took effect in 1981 (beginning with the Reagan administration). In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and both George Bushes as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act, and it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents to temporary archival facilities \u2014 facilities managed by NARA.\n\nNARA said in an October statement that it gained physical and legal custody of Obama, Reagan, H.W. Bush and W. Bush's records, as well of those of President Bill Clinton, \"when those presidents left office.\" It said of the temporary facilities to which the documents were moved: \"All such temporary facilities met strict archival and security standards, and have been managed and staffed exclusively by NARA employees. Reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives, after they left office, or that the records were housed in substandard conditions, are false and misleading.\"\n\nInflation: Trump claimed that the United States has \"an economy that has been crippled by the biggest inflation we have seen in more than 60 years.\"\n\nFacts First: Trump's \"60 years\" claim is an exaggeration, though the inflation rate does remain high by historical standards.\n\nLast June, the year-over-year inflation rate hit its highest level since late 1981, 9.1%. But about 41 years does not round to \"60 years,\" much less \"more than 60 years\". The actual highest year-over-year inflation rate for the last 60 years is 14.8% (in early 1980), far higher than mid-2022 levels. More importantly, year-over-year inflation has now declined for eight straight months, hitting 6% in February 2023 \u2014 not even close to the 60-year high.\n\nThis Trump claim is an example of how the former president tends to increase his exaggerated figures over time. At a campaign rally in Texas in late March, he claimed \u2014 also incorrectly \u2014 that the country had the highest inflation in \"50 years.\"\n\nRead more here.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-new-york-court-arraignment-04-04-23/index.html"}, "article2": {"title": "12 Days That Stunned a Nation: How Hillary Clinton Lost", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two weeks before Election Day, Hillary Clinton held a clear lead in the polls and it looked like her campaign was trying to run up the score \u2014 just as the race was about to turn upside down.\n\nAt 12:37 p.m. ET on Friday, Oct. 28 \u2014 with 12 days left in the election \u2014 the campaign blasted out an advisory to reporters announcing that the former secretary of state would be campaigning in reliably Republican Arizona, a move that suggested her team was gunning to compete in states well beyond the battlegrounds they needed for victory against GOP nominee Donald Trump.\n\nThey had every right to be confident.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics polling average from the day before showed Clinton leading Trump nationally by nearly six points (for perspective, Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by four points in 2012). State polls had Clinton ahead in key battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Even the data team doing analytics for the Trump campaign was telling reporters that, as of Oct. 27, they had just a 15 percent chance of winning.\n\nAll this was happening while early voting was taking place in states across the country.\n\nIn retrospect, however, the race was never as stable as it appeared. A contest featuring the two most unpopular candidates in modern presidential campaign history made the political terrain unstable \u2014 and more susceptible to sudden shifts.\n\nAnd the ground began to move under the Clinton team\u2019s feet just 20 minutes after its Arizona announcement, with a tweet from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who said the FBI was looking at Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 again.\n\n\"FBI Dir just informed me, 'The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.' Case reopened.\"\n\nFBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016\n\nClinton and her team were suddenly on defense, and would remain there for the rest of the race. It was a true October surprise.\n\nIn the nine months since the election, political observers have pointed to various reasons why Hillary Clinton lost and Donald Trump won: FBI Director James Comey\u2019s intervention; Russia and WikiLeaks; Clinton\u2019s failure to campaign in Wisconsin; African-Americans who didn\u2019t turn out as strongly as they did for Obama; and Trump\u2019s strong performance among working-class white voters in the Rust Belt.\n\nBut the real tale of 2016 is how the final 12 days of the election turned a race that seemed out of reach on Oct. 27 into an upset decided by a total of 80,000 votes in three states. To tell that story, NBC News interviewed nearly a dozen top Clinton and Trump operatives for their insight and perspective. Both sides agreed that the underlying volatility of the race, combined with the way the final days unfolded, produced a most unexpected result.\n\n\"Unlike 2012 or 2008, there was a ton of instability in this race,\" said Navin Nayak, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of opinion research. \"If you were the person dominating the news, you went down.\"\n\nIndeed, Clinton\u2019s lead had expanded during rough news cycles about Trump (the Khan family, the debates, the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape), and it shrank during rough news cycles about her (the Clinton Foundation, the 9/11 fainting spell, Comey\u2019s Oct. 28 letter).\n\nAnd that made every day count down the home stretch.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always said, 'God is looking out for us' when Election Day was so much later than usual \u2014 Nov. 8th, not Nov. 4th, not Nov. 3rd,\" said Kellyanne Conway, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager and now works in his administration. \"It really helped to have that [extra] week.\"\n\nEven the Clinton camp\u2019s Arizona announcement that Friday was more about running out the clock \u2014 by giving a hungry press corps something to cover \u2014 than a genuine effort to run up the score, according to multiple Clinton campaign officials interviewed for this article.\n\nThey knew the race was far from over.\n\n\"We were vulnerable to an October surprise,\" said Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign\u2019s national press secretary. \"We were living high on the hog of the 'Access Hollywood' tape,\" he added in reference to their lead in the polls.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the final 12 days changed the race:\n\nOct. 28: \"The biggest political scandal since Watergate\"\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +4.6 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 81.5 percent chance to win\n\nThe first 27 days of October couldn\u2019t have gone better for Clinton \u2014 or worse for Trump.\n\nClinton bested her Republican rival in all three presidential debates, according to snap polls. The \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump was caught boasting that he could do anything to women (like \"grab 'em by the p***y\"), had his campaign in damage-control mode. And it seemed that a different woman each day was accusing Trump of inappropriate behavior.\n\nBy mid-October, Clinton\u2019s lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls had jumped to seven points \u2014 the same as Obama\u2019s winning margin against John McCain in 2008. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll of Pennsylvania showed Clinton ahead of Trump by double digits in that all-important state.\n\nBut that good run for Clinton ended on Friday, Oct. 28, as her 7-point advantage in the RealClear average shrank below 5 points.\n\nComey informed Congress that his agency had found emails in an unrelated case \u2014 a probe into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., then-husband to Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2014 which appeared \"pertinent\" to the investigation into Clinton\u2019s personal email server. And he said the FBI was reviewing them.\n\nStrikingly, Comey\u2019s announcement was vague.\n\n\"Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,\" Comey said in his letter.\n\nSupporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016, in Pensacola, Fla. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nTrump seized on the development, which he used to resurrect the months-long controversy over Clinton\u2019s emails and private server.\n\n\"They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America,\" Trump said on the campaign trail in New Hampshire less than an hour after the news broke. \"Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\"\n\n\"The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it's everybody's hope that justice at last can be delivered. The FBI would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense\" \u2014 candidate Donald Trump in Iowa.\n\nHe would repeat the thrust of this message against Clinton over the next 11 days, and his supporters would respond with \"lock her up\" chants. \"She'll be under investigation for years. She'll be with trials. Our country, we have to get back to work,\" Trump said on Nov. 4 in New Hampshire.\n\n\"If she were to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial,\" he said the next day in Nevada.\n\nThat became Trump\u2019s closing argument \u2014 Watergate, endless investigations, criminal activities and an inability to govern.\n\nOf course, what voters didn\u2019t know until after the election: The FBI, for months, had been investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia.\n\nOct. 31: \"FBI searches emails!\"\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +3.1 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 75.2 percent chance to win\n\nThe Comey story wasn\u2019t just about how Trump seized on it; it also was about how it was covered.\n\nOn October 31, three days after the FBI director\u2019s letter to Congress, Comey continued to dominate headlines and evening newscasts.\n\n\"Clinton Works to Keep Trump and Emails at Bay,\" said The New York Times\n\n\"Get ready for four more years of Clinton scandals,\" was the headline for conservative columnist Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post\n\n\"Is new scandal just like the old scandals? Controversies haven't swayed voters much in the Clinton-Trump race. Email inquiry is the latest test,\" The Los Angeles Times said\n\n\"Email Review Underway,\" was the lead story on NBC\u2019s \"Nightly News\"\n\n\"FBI Searches Emails,\" was the top news that night on ABC\n\n\"FBI Investigation,\" said CBS\n\nNearly half of the lead stories on the three broadcast network's evening newscasts from Oct. 28 to Nov. 7 were about Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nNine months after the election, top officials who worked for both the Clinton and Trump campaigns believe Comey\u2019s intervention \u2014 and its aftermath \u2014 affected the race.\n\nMultiple Trump aides said they gained ground on Clinton after the third presidential debate when the GOP nominee focused on abortion and the Supreme Court, bringing conservative voters back into the fold. They also said they benefited from news stories about rising Obamacare premiums and a sharper campaign message from Trump himself.\n\nComey, they said, added to a snowball that was already moving down the mountainside.\n\n\"It certainly had an effect,\" said Matt Oczkowski, who directed Trump\u2019s analytics team. \"Comey brought these voters out of the woodwork. People had a reason to vote against Clinton.\"\n\nConway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, had a slightly different take.\n\n\"The Comey letter may have been mildly helpful, but it did not lead to 306 electoral votes,\" she said. \"That was baked in the cake earlier on.\"\n\n\"We saw [Clinton] was stuck in neutral, her floor and ceiling were dangerously close together in these key states\" \u2014 then-Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.\n\nBut the Clinton camp believes Comey\u2019s intervention was much more significant.\n\n\"In the last two weeks, it was the only jolt to the system that occurred,\" said Oren Shur, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of paid media. \"We recognized at the time that it was impactful. We didn\u2019t recognize at the time that it was determinative.\"\n\nElections number-cruncher Nate Silver of the website FiveThirtyEight agrees.\n\n\"At a maximum, it might have shifted the race by 3 or 4 percentage points toward Donald Trump, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida to him,\" Silver wrote. \"At a minimum, its impact might have been only a percentage point or so. Still, because Clinton lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by less than 1 point, the letter was probably enough to change the outcome of the Electoral College.\"\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohn has been more skeptical that Comey\u2019s announcement cost Clinton the election, pointing out that her poll numbers had been declining before Oct. 28: \"[I]t\u2019s now clear that Mrs. Clinton was weaker heading into Oct. 28 than was understood at the time. Several other polls were conducted over the same period that showed Mr. Trump gaining quickly on Mrs. Clinton in the days ahead of the Comey letter.\"\n\nIn May, the American Association for Public Opinion Research concluded that the evidence Comey tipped the election to Trump is, at best, mixed. \"[T]he Comey letter had an immediate, negative impact for Clinton on the order of 2 percentage points. The apparent impact did not last, as support for Clinton tended to tick up in the days just prior to the election,\" the association wrote.\n\nBut the way Clinton and her top campaign officials see it, a different president would be sitting in the Oval Office had the race ended two weeks earlier.\n\n\"If the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president,\" Clinton said last spring.\n\nNov. 2: \"Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point\"\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +1.7 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 67.7 percent chance to win\n\nComey wasn\u2019t the only surprise of the final two weeks of the campaign. The other was how Trump, uncharacteristically, stayed on message.\n\nHe was no longer attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, criticizing a Mexican-American judge, or asking: \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\" \u2014 which he had said in what turned out to be his final news conference of the campaign, on July 27.\n\n\"He was remarkably disciplined down the home stretch. You could tell there was a light that went on \u2014 that we\u2019re going to win this thing\" \u2014 a top Trump campaign communications official.\n\n\"We are going to win the White House, gonna win it,\" Trump said in Pensacola, Florida, on Nov. 2. \"Just \u2014we've gotta be nice and cool, nice and cool. Right? Stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump fired off 138 tweets and retweets in the final 12 days of the contest, and none were controversial \u2014 which allowed his campaign to keep the focus on Clinton, and away from its candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day Trump was telling himself to \"stay on point\" in Florida, Clinton made that campaign stop in Arizona.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton watches the World Series baseball game between the Chicago Cub and the Cleveland Indians after her final campaign rally of the day at Arizona State University in Tempe, Ariz., Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. Andrew Harnik / AP\n\n\"This state is in play for the first time in years. Arizona has only voted for a Democrat for president once since 1948, and that was my husband in 1996,\" she told 15,000 voters in Tempe.\n\nIn fact, multiple Clinton campaign officials said in post-election interviews that the Arizona trip was intended to regain a sense of momentum after the final debate on Oct. 19, not as a real play to win the state.\n\nClinton campaign officials were also thinking about proposing a fourth presidential debate, and they had even floated the news that Clinton was considering Vice President Joe Biden as her secretary of state \u2014 anything to change the subject.\n\n\"What had concerned me greatly after the third debate was being [adrift] at sea. No moorings, no bearings, nothing to anchor yourself. The danger zone for us was always when there was nothing else going on in the race,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director.\n\n\"Can the actual election come fast enough?\" Palmieri said in summing up her feelings about the campaign\u2019s final two weeks.\n\nNov. 3: A sigh of relief, or were the polls wrong?\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +1.3 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 66.2 percent to win\n\nThe same day Clinton traveled to Arizona and Trump was urging himself to \"stay on point,\" nail-biting Democrats got some good news from public polls in key battlegrounds taken during and after Comey\u2019s seismic announcement.\n\nA trio of polls had Clinton up 4-5 points in Pennsylvania. She also was narrowly ahead in Florida and North Carolina, although those surveys were well within the margin of error. The gold-standard poll in Wisconsin showed Clinton leading Trump by 6 points in the state.\n\nAs NBC\u2019s First Read concluded on Nov. 3, \"Team Clinton breathes sigh of relief, but they're not in the clear yet.\"\n\nClinton would go on to lose all four of those states on Election Day.\n\nThe national polls, it turned out, were fairly accurate: The final RealClearPolitics average had Clinton ahead by three points. And she ended up winning the national popular vote by 2 points, 48 percent to 46 percent, or nearly 3 million votes.\n\nBut the state polls were a different story, and it wasn\u2019t just the public data. Clinton\u2019s internal polling had her up by about 6 points in Wisconsin at the end of the election. Internal Trump numbers also showed Clinton ahead in the state, although by a smaller margin.\n\nAnd the Republican National Committee was sharing numbers with reporters that had Clinton leading in Florida.\n\n\"Everyone\u2019s data was wrong \u2014 in the same direction \u2014 and that created a conventional wisdom that was off,\" said Nayak of the Clinton campaign.\n\nNov. 4: \"Boy, I love reading WikiLeaks\"\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +1.6 pecent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 64.5 percent chance to win\n\nAnother major plot in the presidential race was Russia\u2019s alleged intervention in the contest \u2014 a story that continues to unfold today.\n\nLess attention, however, has been paid to how Trump and his team seized on that Russian meddling, which the U.S. intelligence community says included the hacking of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s emails \u2014 and their release via WikiLeaks.\n\nThe revelations from Podesta's emails \u2014 including excerpts of Clinton\u2019s paid speech to Goldman Sachs, advisers\u2019 candid criticisms of their candidate and a memo on \"Bill Clinton Inc.\" \u2014 all fueled negative headlines. And Trump pounced:\n\nOct. 31 in Warren, Mich.: \"Did you see where, on WikiLeaks, it was announced that they were paying protesters to be violent, $1,500?... Did you see another one, another one came in today? This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove\"\n\nNov. 2 in Orlando, Fla.: \"WikiLeaks just came out with a new one, just a little a while ago, it's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal, between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign and the State Department\"\n\nNov. 4 in Wilmington, Ohio: \"Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks\"\n\nNBC News counted 145 mentions of WikiLeaks by Trump in the last month of the race.\n\nBeyond the headlines and attacks from the stump that they produced, the WikiLeaks revelations hurt Clinton because voters couldn\u2019t tell the difference between them and the longstanding controversy surrounding Clinton\u2019s own emails, according to top campaign officials.\n\n\"People conflated WikiLeaks with Hillary\u2019s emails,\" said Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director.\n\n\"Benghazi, Comey, WikiLeaks all sounded like the same thing to voters,\" added Robby Mook, the campaign manager.\n\n(Both Russia and WikiLeaks have denied that Russia was behind the 2016 hacks and email revelations.)\n\nNov. 6: \"It's a totally rigged system\"\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +1.8 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 64.9 percent chance to win\n\nComey wasn\u2019t finished making news in the final two weeks of the election. And once again, it was Chaffetz who broke it first.\n\n\"FBI Dir just informed us 'Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton,'\" Chaffetz tweeted about the second letter Comey had sent to Congress.\n\nPart of a Nov. 6, 2016, letter from FBI director James Comey to Congress. Jon Elswick / AP\n\nIn other words, the FBI\u2019s investigation into those additional emails didn\u2019t uncover anything new. Nearly all of them were duplicates of emails the agency had already seen.\n\nTrump railed against Comey's second letter, and he used it to re-litigate the controversy over Clinton's emails, telling voters it was now up to them \"to deliver justice\" on Election Day since no one else would.\n\n\"Right now, she is being protected by a rigged system. It's a totally rigged system,\" Trump said in Michigan.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. And now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on Nov. 8th,\" Trump added.\n\nFor the Clinton campaign, Comey\u2019s second letter appeared to be great news \u2014 it looked like Clinton was in the clear of any wrongdoing.\n\nBut months later, top officials believe the second letter only revived the email story two days before the election.\n\n\"At best, it hurt as much as it helped,\" said the Clinton campaign\u2019s Shur. \"It just brought it all up again,\" Palmieri added.\n\nOn May 3, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Comey at a Senate hearing why he made that Oct. 28 announcement in the first place, especially given existing Justice Department guidelines against interfering in upcoming elections.\n\nComey replied that he faced two options: One, speak about the newly found emails. Or two, conceal them.\n\n\"Speak would be really bad. There's an election in 11 days. Lordy, that would be really bad,\" he told Feinstein. \"Concealing in my view would be catastrophic, not just to the FBI, but well beyond. And honestly, as between really bad and catastrophic, I said to my team we've gotto walk into the world of really bad. I've got to tell Congress that we're restarting this.\"\n\nHe added, \"It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election. But honestly, it wouldn't change the decision.\"\n\nComey was fired six days after that testimony.\n\nNov. 8: Election Day\n\nRealClearPolitics national polling average: Clinton +3.2 percent/FiveThirtyEight forecast: Clinton 71.4 percent chance to win\n\nDespite the jarring events of the final two weeks, all signs still pointed to a Clinton victory. The early-vote numbers from Florida and Nevada looked good for the campaign. And the last national polls \u2014 from NBC News/Wall Street Journal, ABC/Washington Post, CBS and Bloomberg \u2014 boosted Clinton\u2019s lead in the RealClear average above three points.\n\nBut Trump clobbered Clinton in the voting on November 8, especially in key battleground states, as contrasted with the early voting.\n\nTake Florida, for example: Nearly 70 percent of votes were cast in the state before Election Day, and Clinton enjoyed an estimated 4-point lead over Trump \u2014 about 240,000 votes.\n\nVoters line up to vote early at the Supervisor of Elections office on October 24, 2016 in Bradenton, Florida. Joe Raedle / Getty Images\n\n\"[Trump] won Election Day by 13 points,\" said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who closely examined Florida\u2019s early-vote numbers.\n\nAccording to the exit poll data, Trump won those who said they decided their vote in the last week by 11 points in Michigan, 17 points in Pennsylvania and Florida, and a whopping 29 points in Wisconsin. (By contrast, Clinton won the late deciders in Virginia \u2014 a state she carried by five points.)\n\nFrom the Trump team\u2019s perspective, the final 12 days of the campaign allowed them to pull off perhaps the greatest political upset in American history.\n\nThe Trump analytics data that showed him with only a 15 percent chance of winning on Oct. 27 was up to a 35 percent chance by Election Day \u2014 and that was assuming Trump wasn\u2019t going to win Florida.\n\n\"We still didn\u2019t think he was going to be the definitive winner,\" said Oczkowski. \"But 35 percent is within striking distance.\"\n\nBut for the Clinton campaign, the final 12 days \u2014 Comey, WikiLeaks, a more disciplined Trump and drubbing in key battlegrounds on Election Day \u2014 represented their worst two-week stretch of the general election.\n\n\"Campaigns have been told for years to expect the unexpected. But in this election we needed to expect the unbelievable, and we didn't,\" said Jesse Ferguson, the Clinton campaign\u2019s deputy national press secretary and senior spokesperson.\n\n\"A lot of things came together to create what happened,\" Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, told NBC News. \"We had a bunch of black swans that converged on us.\"", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/12-days-stunned-nation-how-hillary-clinton-lost-n794131"}, "article3": {"title": "A Psychologist Analyzes Donald Trump\u2019s Personality", "content": "In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate\u2019s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D\u2019Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin\u2019s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage.\n\n\u201cIt was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,\u201d Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.\n\nThe same feeling perplexed Mark Singer in the late 1990s when he was working on a profile of Trump for The New Yorker. Singer wondered what went through his mind when he was not playing the public role of Donald Trump. What are you thinking about, Singer asked him, when you are shaving in front of the mirror in the morning? Trump, Singer writes, appeared baffled. Hoping to uncover the man behind the actor\u2019s mask, Singer tried a different tack:\n\n\u201cO.K., I guess I\u2019m asking, do you consider yourself ideal company?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really want to know what I consider ideal company?,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cA total piece of ass.\u201d\n\nI might have phrased Singer\u2019s question this way: Who are you, Mr. Trump, when you are alone? Singer never got an answer, leaving him to conclude that the real-estate mogul who would become a reality-TV star and, after that, a leading candidate for president of the United States had managed to achieve something remarkable: \u201can existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul.\u201d\n\nIs Singer\u2019s assessment too harsh? Perhaps it is, in at least one sense. As brainy social animals, human beings evolved to be consummate actors whose survival and ability to reproduce depend on the quality of our performances. We enter the world prepared to perform roles and manage the impressions of others, with the ultimate evolutionary aim of getting along and getting ahead in the social groups that define who we are.\n\nMore than even Ronald Reagan, Trump seems supremely cognizant of the fact that he is always acting. He moves through life like a man who knows he is always being observed. If all human beings are, by their very nature, social actors, then Donald Trump seems to be more so\u2014superhuman, in this one primal sense.\n\nMany questions have arisen about Trump during this campaign season\u2014about his platform, his knowledge of issues, his inflammatory language, his level of comfort with political violence. This article touches on some of that. But its central aim is to create a psychological portrait of the man. Who is he, really? How does his mind work? How might he go about making decisions in office, were he to become president? And what does all that suggest about the sort of president he\u2019d be?\n\nMark Peterson / Redux\n\nIn creating this portrait, I will draw from well-validated concepts in the fields of personality, developmental, and social psychology. Ever since Sigmund Freud analyzed the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci, in 1910, scholars have applied psychological lenses to the lives of famous people. Many early efforts relied upon untested, nonscientific ideas. In recent years, however, psychologists have increasingly used the tools and concepts of psychological science to shed light on notable lives, as I did in a 2011 book on George W. Bush. A large and rapidly growing body of research shows that people\u2019s temperament, their characteristic motivations and goals, and their internal conceptions of themselves are powerful predictors of what they will feel, think, and do in the future, and powerful aids in explaining why. In the realm of politics, psychologists have recently demonstrated how fundamental features of human personality\u2014such as extroversion and narcissism\u2014shaped the distinctive leadership styles of past U. S. presidents, and the decisions they made. While a range of factors, such as world events and political realities, determine what political leaders can and will do in office, foundational tendencies in human personality, which differ dramatically from one leader to the next, are among them.\n\nTrump\u2019s personality is certainly extreme by any standard, and particularly rare for a presidential candidate; many people who encounter the man\u2014in negotiations or in interviews or on a debate stage or watching that debate on television\u2014seem to find him flummoxing. In this essay, I will seek to uncover the key dispositions, cognitive styles, motivations, and self-conceptions that together comprise his unique psychological makeup. Trump declined to be interviewed for this story, but his life history has been well documented in his own books and speeches, in biographical sources, and in the press. My aim is to develop a dispassionate and analytical perspective on Trump, drawing upon some of the most important ideas and research findings in psychological science today.\n\nI. His Disposition\n\nFifty years of empirical research in personality psychology have resulted in a scientific consensus regarding the most basic dimensions of human variability. There are countless ways to differentiate one person from the next, but psychological scientists have settled on a relatively simple taxonomy, known widely as the Big Five:\n\nExtroversion: gregariousness, social dominance, enthusiasm, reward-seeking behavior\n\nNeuroticism: anxiety, emotional instability, depressive tendencies, negative emotions\n\nConscientiousness: industriousness, discipline, rule abidance, organization\n\nAgreeableness: warmth, care for others, altruism, compassion, modesty\n\nOpenness: curiosity, unconventionality, imagination, receptivity to new ideas\n\nMost people score near the middle on any given dimension, but some score toward one pole or the other. Research decisively shows that higher scores on extroversion are associated with greater happiness and broader social connections, higher scores on conscientiousness predict greater success in school and at work, and higher scores on agreeableness are associated with deeper relationships. By contrast, higher scores on neuroticism are always bad, having proved to be a risk factor for unhappiness, dysfunctional relationships, and mental-health problems. From adolescence through midlife, many people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable, and less neurotic, but these changes are typically slight: The Big Five personality traits are pretty stable across a person\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThe psychologists Steven J. Rubenzer and Thomas R. Faschingbauer, in conjunction with about 120 historians and other experts, have rated all the former U.S. presidents, going back to George Washington, on all five of the trait dimensions. George W. Bush comes out as especially high on extroversion and low on openness to experience\u2014a highly enthusiastic and outgoing social actor who tends to be incurious and intellectually rigid. Barack Obama is relatively introverted, at least for a politician, and almost preternaturally low on neuroticism\u2014emotionally calm and dispassionate, perhaps to a fault.\n\nAcross his lifetime, Donald Trump has exhibited a trait profile that you would not expect of a U.S. president: sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness. This is my own judgment, of course, but I believe that a great majority of people who observe Trump would agree. There is nothing especially subtle about trait attributions. We are not talking here about deep, unconscious processes or clinical diagnoses. As social actors, our performances are out there for everyone to see.\n\nLike George W. Bush and Bill Clinton (and Teddy Roosevelt, who tops the presidential extroversion list), Trump plays his role in an outgoing, exuberant, and socially dominant manner. He is a dynamo\u2014driven, restless, unable to keep still. He gets by with very little sleep. In his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Trump described his days as stuffed with meetings and phone calls. Some 30 years later, he is still constantly interacting with other people\u2014at rallies, in interviews, on social media. Presidential candidates on the campaign trail are studies in perpetual motion. But nobody else seems to embrace the campaign with the gusto of Trump. And no other candidate seems to have so much fun. A sampling of his tweets at the time of this writing:\n\n3:13 a.m., April 12: \u201cWOW, great new poll\u2014New York! Thank you for your support!\u201d 4:22 a.m., April 9: \u201cBernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!\u201d 5:03 a.m., April 8: \u201cSo great to be in New York. Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign), and loving it!\u201d 12:25 p.m., April 5: \u201cWow, @Politico is in total disarray with almost everyone quitting. Good news\u2014bad, dishonest journalists!\u201d\n\nA cardinal feature of high extroversion is relentless reward-seeking. Prompted by the activity of dopamine circuits in the brain, highly extroverted actors are driven to pursue positive emotional experiences, whether they come in the form of social approval, fame, or wealth. Indeed, it is the pursuit itself, more so even than the actual attainment of the goal, that extroverts find so gratifying. When Barbara Walters asked Trump in 1987 whether he would like to be appointed president of the United States, rather than having to run for the job, Trump said no: \u201cIt\u2019s the hunt that I believe I love.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s agreeableness seems even more extreme than his extroversion, but in the opposite direction. Arguably the most highly valued human trait the world over, agreeableness pertains to the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind. Trump loves his family, for sure. He is reported to be a generous and fair-minded boss. There is even a famous story about his meeting with a boy who was dying of cancer. A fan of The Apprentice, the young boy simply wanted Trump to tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Trump could not bring himself to do it, but instead wrote the boy a check for several thousand dollars and told him, \u201cGo and have the time of your life.\u201d But like extroversion and the other Big Five traits, agreeableness is about an overall style of relating to others and to the world, and these noteworthy exceptions run against the broad social reputation Trump has garnered as a remarkably disagreeable person, based upon a lifetime of widely observed interactions. People low in agreeableness are described as callous, rude, arrogant, and lacking in empathy. If Donald Trump does not score low on this personality dimension, then probably nobody does.\n\nExplore the June 2016 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

But he was sweetness and light compared with the man who once sent The New York Times\u2019 Gail Collins a copy of her own column with her photo circled and the words \u201cThe Face of a Dog!\u201d scrawled on it. Complaining in Never Enough about \u201csome nasty shit\u201d that Cher, the singer and actress, once said about him, Trump bragged: \u201cI knocked the shit out of her\u201d on Twitter, \u201cand she never said a thing about me after that.\u201d At campaign rallies, Trump has encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters. \u201cGet \u2019em out of here!\u201d he yells. \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d From unsympathetic journalists to political rivals, Trump calls his opponents \u201cdisgusting\u201d and writes them off as \u201closers.\u201d By the standards of reality TV, Trump\u2019s disagreeableness may not be so shocking. But political candidates who want people to vote for them rarely behave like this.\n\nTrump\u2019s tendencies toward social ambition and aggressiveness were evident very early in his life, as we will see later. (By his own account, he once punched his second-grade music teacher, giving him a black eye.) According to Barbara Res, who in the early 1980s served as vice president in charge of construction of Trump Tower in Manhattan, the emotional core around which Donald Trump\u2019s personality constellates is anger: \u201cAs far as the anger is concerned, that\u2019s real for sure. He\u2019s not faking it,\u201d she told The Daily Beast in February. \u201cThe fact that he gets mad, that\u2019s his personality.\u201d Indeed, anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump\u2019s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. Anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. Combined with a considerable gift for humor (which may also be aggressive), anger lies at the heart of Trump\u2019s charisma. And anger permeates his political rhetoric.\n\nImagine Donald Trump in the White House. What kind of decision maker might he be?\n\nIt is very difficult to predict the actions a president will take. When the dust settled after the 2000 election, did anybody foresee that George W. Bush would someday launch a preemptive invasion of Iraq? If so, I haven\u2019t read about it. Bush probably would never have gone after Saddam Hussein if 9/11 had not happened. But world events invariably hijack a presidency. Obama inherited a devastating recession, and after the 2010 midterm elections, he struggled with a recalcitrant Republican Congress. What kinds of decisions might he have made had these events not occurred? We will never know.\n\nMark Peterson / Redux\n\nStill, dispositional personality traits may provide clues to a president\u2019s decision-making style. Research suggests that extroverts tend to take high-stakes risks and that people with low levels of openness rarely question their deepest convictions. Entering office with high levels of extroversion and very low openness, Bush was predisposed to make bold decisions aimed at achieving big rewards, and to make them with the assurance that he could not be wrong. As I argued in my psychological biography of Bush, the game-changing decision to invade Iraq was the kind of decision he was likely to make. As world events transpired to open up an opportunity for the invasion, Bush found additional psychological affirmation both in his lifelong desire\u2014pursued again and again before he ever became president\u2014to defend his beloved father from enemies (think: Saddam Hussein) and in his own life story, wherein the hero liberates himself from oppressive forces (think: sin, alcohol) to restore peace and freedom.\n\nLike Bush, a President Trump might try to swing for the fences in an effort to deliver big payoffs\u2014to make America great again, as his campaign slogan says. As a real-estate developer, he has certainly taken big risks, although he has become a more conservative businessman following setbacks in the 1990s. As a result of the risks he has taken, Trump can (and does) point to luxurious urban towers, lavish golf courses, and a personal fortune that is, by some estimates, in the billions, all of which clearly bring him big psychic rewards. Risky decisions have also resulted in four Chapter 11 business bankruptcies involving some of his casinos and resorts. Because he is not burdened with Bush\u2019s low level of openness (psychologists have rated Bush at the bottom of the list on this trait), Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like Bill Clinton than Bush: He may look longer and harder than Bush did before he leaps. And because he is viewed as markedly less ideological than most presidential candidates (political observers note that on some issues he seems conservative, on others liberal, and on still others nonclassifiable), Trump may be able to switch positions easily, leaving room to maneuver in negotiations with Congress and foreign leaders. But on balance, he\u2019s unlikely to shy away from risky decisions that, should they work out, could burnish his legacy and provide him an emotional payoff.\n\nThe real psychological wild card, however, is Trump\u2019s agreeableness\u2014or lack thereof. There has probably never been a U.S. president as consistently and overtly disagreeable on the public stage as Donald Trump is. If Nixon comes closest, we might predict that Trump\u2019s style of decision making would look like the hard-nosed realpolitik that Nixon and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, displayed in international affairs during the early 1970s, along with its bare-knuckled domestic analog. That may not be all bad, depending on one\u2019s perspective. Not readily swayed by warm sentiments or humanitarian impulses, decision makers who, like Nixon, are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries, such as China in Nixon\u2019s time. In international affairs, Nixon was tough, pragmatic, and coolly rational. Trump seems capable of a similar toughness and strategic pragmatism, although the cool rationality does not always seem to fit, probably because Trump\u2019s disagreeableness appears so strongly motivated by anger.\n\nIn domestic politics, Nixon was widely recognized to be cunning, callous, cynical, and Machiavellian, even by the standards of American politicians. Empathy was not his strong suit. This sounds a lot like Donald Trump, too\u2014except you have to add the ebullient extroversion, the relentless showmanship, and the larger-than-life celebrity. Nixon could never fill a room the way Trump can.\n\nResearch shows that people low in agreeableness are typically viewed as untrustworthy. Dishonesty and deceit brought down Nixon and damaged the institution of the presidency. It is generally believed today that all politicians lie, or at least dissemble, but Trump appears extreme in this regard. Assessing the truthfulness of the 2016 candidates\u2019 campaign statements, PolitiFact recently calculated that only 2 percent of the claims made by Trump are true, 7 percent are mostly true, 15 percent are half true, 15 percent are mostly false, 42 percent are false, and 18 percent are \u201cpants on fire.\u201d Adding up the last three numbers (from mostly false to flagrantly so), Trump scores 75 percent. The corresponding figures for Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, respectively, are 66, 32, 31, and 29 percent.\n\nIn sum, Donald Trump\u2019s basic personality traits suggest a presidency that could be highly combustible. One possible yield is an energetic, activist president who has a less than cordial relationship with the truth. He could be a daring and ruthlessly aggressive decision maker who desperately desires to create the strongest, tallest, shiniest, and most awesome result\u2014and who never thinks twice about the collateral damage he will leave behind. Tough. Bellicose. Threatening. Explosive.\n\nIn the presidential contest of 1824, Andrew Jackson won the most electoral votes, edging out John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and William Crawford. Because Jackson did not have a majority, however, the election was decided in the House of Representatives, where Adams prevailed. Adams subsequently chose Clay as his secretary of state. Jackson\u2019s supporters were infuriated by what they described as a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d between Adams and Clay. The Washington establishment had defied the will of the people, they believed. Jackson rode the wave of public resentment to victory four years later, marking a dramatic turning point in American politics. A beloved hero of western farmers and frontiersmen, Jackson was the first nonaristocrat to become president. He was the first president to invite everyday folk to the inaugural reception. To the horror of the political elite, throngs tracked mud through the White House and broke dishes and decorative objects. Washington insiders reviled Jackson. They saw him as intemperate, vulgar, and stupid. Opponents called him a jackass\u2014the origin of the donkey symbol for the Democratic Party. In a conversation with Daniel Webster in 1824, Thomas Jefferson described Jackson as \u201cone of the most unfit men I know of\u201d to become president of the United States, \u201ca dangerous man\u201d who cannot speak in a civilized manner because he \u201cchoke[s] with rage,\u201d a man whose \u201cpassions are terrible.\u201d Jefferson feared that the slightest insult from a foreign leader could impel Jackson to declare war. Even Jackson\u2019s friends and admiring colleagues feared his volcanic temper. Jackson fought at least 14 duels in his life, leaving him with bullet fragments lodged throughout his body. On the last day of his presidency, he admitted to only two regrets: that he was never able to shoot Henry Clay or hang John C. Calhoun.\n\nCombined with a gift for humor, anger lies at the heart of Trump\u2019s charisma.\n\nThe similarities between Andrew Jackson and Donald Trump do not end with their aggressive temperaments and their respective positions as Washington outsiders. The similarities extend to the dynamic created between these dominant social actors and their adoring audiences\u2014or, to be fairer to Jackson, what Jackson\u2019s political opponents consistently feared that dynamic to be. They named Jackson \u201cKing Mob\u201d for what they perceived as his demagoguery. Jackson was an angry populist, they believed\u2014a wild-haired mountain man who channeled the crude sensibilities of the masses. More than 100 years before social scientists would invent the concept of the authoritarian personality to explain the people who are drawn to autocratic leaders, Jackson\u2019s detractors feared what a popular strongman might do when encouraged by an angry mob.\n\nDuring and after World War II, psychologists conceived of the authoritarian personality as a pattern of attitudes and values revolving around adherence to society\u2019s traditional norms, submission to authorities who personify or reinforce those norms, and antipathy\u2014to the point of hatred and aggression\u2014toward those who either challenge in-group norms or lie outside their orbit. Among white Americans, high scores on measures of authoritarianism today tend to be associated with prejudice against a wide range of \u201cout-groups,\u201d including homosexuals, African Americans, immigrants, and Muslims. Authoritarianism is also associated with suspiciousness of the humanities and the arts, and with cognitive rigidity, militaristic sentiments, and Christian fundamentalism.\n\nWhen individuals with authoritarian proclivities fear that their way of life is being threatened, they may turn to strong leaders who promise to keep them safe\u2014leaders like Donald Trump. In a national poll conducted recently by the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams, high levels of authoritarianism emerged as the single strongest predictor of expressing political support for Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out and his railing against Muslims and other outsiders have presumably fed that dynamic.\n\nAs the social psychologist Jesse Graham has noted, Trump appeals to an ancient fear of contagion, which analogizes out-groups to parasites, poisons, and other impurities. In this regard, it is perhaps no psychological accident that Trump displays a phobia of germs, and seems repulsed by bodily fluids, especially women\u2019s. He famously remarked that Megyn Kelly of Fox News had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever,\u201d and he repeatedly characterized Hillary Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during a Democratic debate as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Disgust is a primal response to impurity. On a daily basis, Trump seems to experience more disgust, or at least to say he does, than most people do.\n\nThe authoritarian mandate is to ensure the security, purity, and goodness of the in-group\u2014to keep the good stuff in and the bad stuff out. In the 1820s, white settlers in Georgia and other frontier areas lived in constant fear of American Indian tribes. They resented the federal government for not keeping them safe from what they perceived to be a mortal threat and a corrupting contagion. Responding to these fears, President Jackson pushed hard for the passage of the Indian Removal Act, which eventually led to the forced relocation of 45,000 American Indians. At least 4,000 Cherokees died on the Trail of Tears, which ran from Georgia to the Oklahoma territory.\n\nAn American strand of authoritarianism may help explain why the thrice-married, foul-mouthed Donald Trump should prove to be so attractive to white Christian evangelicals. As Jerry Falwell Jr. told The New York Times in February, \u201cAll the social issues\u2014traditional family values, abortion\u2014are moot if isis blows up some of our cities or if the borders are not fortified.\u201d Rank-and-file evangelicals \u201care trying to save the country,\u201d Falwell said. Being \u201csaved\u201d has a special resonance among evangelicals\u2014saved from sin and damnation, of course, but also saved from the threats and impurities of a corrupt and dangerous world.\n\nTrump appeals to an ancient fear of contagion, which analogizes out-groups to parasites and poisons.\n\nWhen my research associates and I once asked politically conservative Christians scoring high on authoritarianism to imagine what their life (and their world) might have been like had they never found religious faith, many described utter chaos\u2014families torn apart, rampant infidelity and hate, cities on fire, the inner rings of hell. By contrast, equally devout politically liberal Christians who scored low on authoritarianism described a barren world depleted of all resources, joyless and bleak, like the arid surface of the moon. For authoritarian Christians, a strong faith\u2014like a strong leader\u2014saves them from chaos and tamps down fears and conflicts. Donald Trump is a savior, even if he preens and swears, and waffles on the issue of abortion.\n\nIn December, on the campaign trail in Raleigh, North Carolina, Trump stoked fears in his audience by repeatedly saying that \u201csomething bad is happening\u201d and \u201csomething really dangerous is going on.\u201d He was asked by a 12-year-old girl from Virginia, \u201cI\u2019m scared\u2014what are you going to do to protect this country?\u201d\n\nTrump responded: \u201cYou know what, darling? You\u2019re not going to be scared anymore. They\u2019re going to be scared.\u201d\n\nII. His Mental Habits\n\nIn The Art of the Deal, Trump counsels executives, CEOs, and other deal makers to \u201cthink big,\u201d \u201cuse your leverage,\u201d and always \u201cfight back.\u201d When you go into a negotiation, you must begin from a position of unassailable strength. You must project bigness. \u201cI aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I\u2019m after,\u201d he writes.\n\nFor Trump, the concept of \u201cthe deal\u201d represents what psychologists call a personal schema\u2014a way of knowing the world that permeates his thoughts. Cognitive-science research suggests that people rely on personal schemata to process new social information efficiently and effectively. By their very nature, however, schemata narrow a person\u2019s focus to a few well-worn approaches that may have worked in the past, but may not necessarily bend to accommodate changing circumstances. A key to successful decision making is knowing what your schemata are, so that you can change them when you need to.\n\nTrump, shown here at the opening of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City in 1990, is dispositionally inclined to high-risk, high-reward decisions, as are many extroverts. His personality is similar to George W. Bush\u2019s in this respect. (Mike Derer / AP)\n\nIn the negotiations for the Menie Estate in Scotland, Trump wore Tom Griffin down by making one outlandish demand after another and bargaining hard on even the most trivial issues of disagreement. He never quit fighting. \u201cSometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition,\u201d Trump writes. When local residents refused to sell properties that Trump needed in order to finish the golf resort, he ridiculed them on the Late Show With David Letterman and in newspapers, describing the locals as rubes who lived in \u201cdisgusting\u201d ramshackle hovels. As D\u2019Antonio recounts in Never Enough, Trump\u2019s attacks incurred the enmity of millions in the British Isles, inspired an award-winning documentary highly critical of Trump (You\u2019ve Been Trumped), and transformed a local farmer and part-time fisherman named Michael Forbes into a national hero. After painting the words no golf course on his barn and telling Trump he could \u201ctake his money and shove it up his arse,\u201d Forbes received the 2012 Top Scot honor at the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards. (That same year, Trump\u2019s golf course was completed nonetheless. He promised that its construction would create 1,200 permanent jobs in the Aberdeen area, but to date, only about 200 have been documented.)\n\nTrump\u2019s recommendations for successful deal making include less antagonistic strategies: \u201cprotect the downside\u201d (anticipate what can go wrong), \u201cmaximize your options,\u201d \u201cknow your market,\u201d \u201cget the word out,\u201d and \u201chave fun.\u201d As president, Trump would negotiate better trade deals with China, he says, guarantee a better health-care system by making deals with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, and force Mexico to agree to a deal whereby it would pay for a border wall. On the campaign trail, he has often said that he would simply pick up the phone and call people\u2014say, a CEO wishing to move his company to Mexico\u2014in order to make propitious deals for the American people.\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on personal relationships and one-on-one negotiating pays respect to a venerable political tradition. For example, a contributor to Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s success in pushing through civil-rights legislation and other social programs in the 1960s was his unparalleled expertise in cajoling lawmakers. Obama, by contrast, has been accused of failing to put in the personal effort needed to forge close and productive relationships with individual members of Congress.\n\nHaving said that, deal making is an apt description for only some presidential activities, and the modern presidency is too complex to rely mainly on personal relationships. Presidents work within institutional frameworks that transcend the idiosyncratic relationships between specific people, be they heads of state, Cabinet secretaries, or members of Congress. The most-effective leaders are able to maintain some measure of distance from the social and emotional fray of everyday politics. Keeping the big picture in mind and balancing a myriad of competing interests, they cannot afford to invest too heavily in any particular relationship. For U.S. presidents, the political is not merely personal. It has to be much more.\n\nTrump has hinted at other means through which he might address the kind of complex, long-standing problems that presidents face. \u201cHere\u2019s the way I work,\u201d he writes in Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again, the campaign manifesto he published late last year. \u201cI find the people who are the best in the world at what needs to be done, then I hire them to do it, and then I let them do it \u2026 but I always watch over them.\u201d And Trump knows that he cannot do it alone:\n\nMany of our problems, caused by years of stupid decisions, or no decisions at all, have grown into a huge mess. If I could wave a magic wand and fix them, I\u2019d do it. But there are a lot of different voices\u2014and interests\u2014that have to be considered when working toward solutions. This involves getting people into a room and negotiating compromises until everyone walks out of that room on the same page.\n\nAmid the polarized political rhetoric of 2016, it is refreshing to hear a candidate invoke the concept of compromise and acknowledge that different voices need to be heard. Still, Trump\u2019s image of a bunch of people in a room hashing things out connotes a neater and more self-contained process than political reality affords. It is possible that Trump could prove to be adept as the helmsman of an unwieldy government whose operation involves much more than striking deals\u2014but that would require a set of schemata and skills that appear to lie outside his accustomed way of solving problems.\n\nIII. His Motivations\n\nFor psychologists, it is almost impossible to talk about Donald Trump without using the word narcissism. Asked to sum up Trump\u2019s personality for an article in Vanity Fair, Howard Gardner, a psychologist at Harvard, responded, \u201cRemarkably narcissistic.\u201d George Simon, a clinical psychologist who conducts seminars on manipulative behavior, says Trump is \u201cso classic that I\u2019m archiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there\u2019s no better example\u201d of narcissism. \u201cOtherwise I would have had to hire actors and write vignettes. He\u2019s like a dream come true.\u201d\n\nWhen I walk north on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, where I live, I often stop to admire the sleek tower that Trump built on the Chicago River. But why did he have to stencil his name in 20\u2011foot letters across the front? As nearly everybody knows, Trump has attached his name to pretty much everything he has ever touched\u2014from casinos to steaks to a so-called university that promised to teach students how to become rich. Self-references pervade Trump\u2019s speeches and conversations, too. When, in the summer of 1999, he stood up to offer remarks at his father\u2019s funeral, Trump spoke mainly about himself. It was the toughest day of his own life, Trump began. He went on to talk about Fred Trump\u2019s greatest achievement: raising a brilliant and renowned son. As Gwenda Blair writes in her three-generation biography of the Trump family, The Trumps, \u201cthe first-person singular pronouns, the I and me and my, eclipsed the he and his. Where others spoke of their memories of Fred Trump, [Donald] spoke of Fred Trump\u2019s endorsement.\u201d\n\nIn the ancient Greek legend, the beautiful boy Narcissus falls so completely in love with the reflection of himself in a pool that he plunges into the water and drowns. The story provides the mythical source for the modern concept of narcissism, which is conceived as excessive self-love and the attendant qualities of grandiosity and a sense of entitlement. Highly narcissistic people are always trying to draw attention to themselves. Repeated and inordinate self-reference is a distinguishing feature of their personality.\n\nNarcissism in presidents is a double-edged sword. It is associated with historians\u2019 ratings of \u201cgreatness\u201d\u2014but also with impeachment resolutions.\n\nTo consider the role of narcissism in Donald Trump\u2019s life is to go beyond the dispositional traits of the social actor\u2014beyond the high extroversion and low agreeableness, beyond his personal schemata for decision making\u2014to try to figure out what motivates the man. What does Donald Trump really want? What are his most valued life goals?\n\nNarcissus wanted, more than anything else, to love himself. People with strong narcissistic needs want to love themselves, and they desperately want others to love them too\u2014or at least admire them, see them as brilliant and powerful and beautiful, even just see them, period. The fundamental life goal is to promote the greatness of the self, for all to see. \u201cI\u2019m the king of Palm Beach,\u201d Trump told the journalist Timothy O\u2019Brien for his 2005 book, TrumpNation. Celebrities and rich people \u201call come over\u201d to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s exclusive Palm Beach estate. \u201cThey all eat, they all love me, they all kiss my ass. And then they all leave and say, \u2018Isn\u2019t he horrible.\u2019 But I\u2019m the king.\u201d\n\nThe renowned psychoanalytic theorist Heinz Kohut argued that narcissism stems from a deficiency in early-life mirroring: The parents fail to lovingly reflect back the young boy\u2019s (or girl\u2019s) own budding grandiosity, leaving the child in desperate need of affirmation from others. Accordingly, some experts insist that narcissistic motivations cover up an underlying insecurity. But others argue that there is nothing necessarily compensatory, or even immature, about certain forms of narcissism. Consistent with this view, I can find no evidence in the biographical record to suggest that Donald Trump experienced anything but a loving relationship with his mother and father. Narcissistic people like Trump may seek glorification over and over, but not necessarily because they suffered from negative family dynamics as children. Rather, they simply cannot get enough. The parental praise and strong encouragement that might reinforce a sense of security for most boys and young men may instead have added rocket fuel to Donald Trump\u2019s hot ambitions.\n\nEver since grade school, Trump has wanted to be No. 1. Attending New York Military Academy for high school, he was relatively popular among his peers and with the faculty, but he did not have any close confidants. As both a coach and an admiring classmate recall in The Trumps, Donald stood out for being the most competitive young man in a very competitive environment. His need to excel\u2014to be the best athlete in school, for example, and to chart out the most ambitious future career\u2014may have crowded out intense friendships by making it impossible for him to show the kind of weakness and vulnerability that true intimacy typically requires.\n\nWhereas you might think that narcissism would be part of the job description for anybody aspiring to become the chief executive of the United States, American presidents appear to have varied widely on this psychological construct. In a 2013 Psychological Science research article, behavioral scientists ranked U.S. presidents on characteristics of what the authors called \u201cgrandiose narcissism.\u201d Lyndon Johnson scored the highest, followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson. Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Nixon, and Clinton were next. Millard Fillmore ranked the lowest. Correlating these ranks with objective indices of presidential performance, the researchers found that narcissism in presidents is something of a double-edged sword. On the positive side, grandiose narcissism is associated with initiating legislation, public persuasiveness, agenda setting, and historians\u2019 ratings of \u201cgreatness.\u201d On the negative side, it is also associated with unethical behavior and congressional impeachment resolutions.\n\nMark Peterson / Redux\n\nIn business, government, sports, and many other arenas, people will put up with a great deal of self-serving and obnoxious behavior on the part of narcissists as long as the narcissists continually perform at high levels. Steve Jobs was, in my opinion, every bit Trump\u2019s equal when it comes to grandiose narcissism. He heaped abuse on colleagues, subordinates, and friends; cried, at age 27, when he learned that Time magazine had not chosen him to be Man of the Year; and got upset when he received a congratulatory phone call, following the iPad\u2019s introduction in 2010, from President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, rather than the president himself. Unlike Trump, he basically ignored his kids, to the point of refusing to acknowledge for some time that one of them was his.\n\nPsychological research demonstrates that many narcissists come across as charming, witty, and charismatic upon initial acquaintance. They can attain high levels of popularity and esteem in the short term. As long as they prove to be successful and brilliant\u2014like Steve Jobs\u2014they may be able to weather criticism and retain their exalted status. But more often than not, narcissists wear out their welcome. Over time, people become annoyed, if not infuriated, by their self-centeredness. When narcissists begin to disappoint those whom they once dazzled, their descent can be especially precipitous. There is still truth today in the ancient proverb: Pride goeth before the fall.\n\nIV. His Self-Conception\n\nThe president of the United States is more than a chief executive. He (or she) is also a symbol, for the nation and for the world, of what it means to be an American. Much of the president\u2019s power to represent and to inspire comes from narrative. It is largely through the stories he tells or personifies, and through the stories told about him, that a president exerts moral force and fashions a nation-defining legacy.\n\nLike all of us, presidents create in their minds personal life stories\u2014or what psychologists call narrative identities\u2014to explain how they came to be who they are. This process is often unconscious, involving the selective reinterpretation of the past and imagination of the future. A growing body of research in personality, developmental, and social psychology demonstrates that a life story provides adults with a sense of coherence, purpose, and continuity over time. Presidents\u2019 narratives about themselves can also color their view of national identity, and influence their understanding of national priorities and progress.\n\nIn middle age, George W. Bush formulated a life story that traced the transformation of a drunken ne\u2019er-do-well into a self-regulated man of God. Key events in the story were his decision to marry a steady librarian at age 31, his conversion to evangelical Christianity in his late 30s, and his giving up alcohol forever the day after his 40th birthday party. By atoning for his sins and breaking his addiction, Bush was able to recover the feeling of control and freedom that he had enjoyed as a young boy growing up in Midland, Texas. Extending his narrative to the story of his country, Bush believed that American society could recapture the wholesome family values and small-town decency of yesteryear, by embracing a brand of compassionate conservatism. On the international front, he believed that oppressed people everywhere could enjoy the same kind of God-given rights\u2014self-determination and freedom\u2014if they could be emancipated from their oppressors. His redemptive story helped him justify, for better and for worse, a foreign war aimed at overthrowing a tyrant.\n\nIn Dreams From My Father, Barack Obama told his own redemptive life story, tracking a move from enslavement to liberation. Obama, of course, did not directly experience the horrors of slavery or the indignities of Jim Crow discrimination. But he imagined himself as the heir to that legacy, the Joshua to the Moses of Martin Luther King Jr. and other past advocates for human rights who had cleared a path for him. His story was a progressive narrative of ascent that mirrored the nation\u2019s march toward equality and freedom\u2014the long arc of history that bends toward justice, as King described it. Obama had already identified himself as a protagonist in this grand narrative by the time he married Michelle Robinson, at age 31.\n\nWhat about Donald Trump? What is the narrative he has constructed in his own mind about how he came to be the person he is today? And can we find inspiration there for a compelling American story?\n\nTrump in 1987 with his father, Fred, his sister-in-law Blaine, and his brother Robert. When Trump was a child, his father encouraged him to be a \u201ckiller,\u201d and sought to channel his aggression. (Robert Maass / Corbis)\n\nOur narrative identities typically begin with our earliest memories of childhood. Rather than faithful reenactments of the past as it actually was, these distant memories are more like mythic renderings of what we imagine the world to have been. Bush\u2019s earliest recollections were about innocence, freedom, and good times growing up on the West Texas plains. For Obama, there is a sense of wonder but also confusion about his place in the world. Donald Trump grew up in a wealthy 1950s family with a mother who was devoted to the children and a father who was devoted to work. Parked in front of their mansion in Jamaica Estates, Queens, was a Cadillac for him and a Rolls-Royce for her. All five Trump children\u2014Donald was the fourth\u2014enjoyed a family environment in which their parents loved them and loved each other. And yet the first chapter in Donald Trump\u2019s story, as he tells it today, expresses nothing like Bush\u2019s gentle nostalgia or Obama\u2019s curiosity. Instead, it is saturated with a sense of danger and a need for toughness: The world cannot be trusted.\n\nFred Trump made a fortune building, owning, and managing apartment complexes in Queens and Brooklyn. On weekends, he would occasionally take one or two of his children along to inspect buildings. \u201cHe would drag me around with him while he collected small rents in tough sections of Brooklyn,\u201d Donald recalls in Crippled America. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun being a landlord. You have to be tough.\u201d On one such trip, Donald asked Fred why he always stood to the side of the tenant\u2019s door after ringing the bell. \u201cBecause sometimes they shoot right through the door,\u201d his father replied. While Fred\u2019s response may have been an exaggeration, it reflected his worldview. He trained his sons to be tough competitors, because his own experience taught him that if you were not vigilant and fierce, you would never survive in business. His lessons in toughness dovetailed with Donald\u2019s inborn aggressive temperament. \u201cGrowing up in Queens, I was a pretty tough kid,\u201d Trump writes. \u201cI wanted to be the toughest kid in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nFred applauded Donald\u2019s toughness and encouraged him to be a \u201ckiller,\u201d but he was not too keen about the prospects of juvenile delinquency. His decision to send his 13-year-old son off to military school, so as to alloy aggression with discipline, followed Donald\u2019s trip on the subway into Manhattan, with a friend, to purchase switchblades. As Trump tells it decades later, New York Military Academy was \u201ca tough, tough place. There were ex\u2013drill sergeants all over the place.\u201d The instructors \u201cused to beat the shit out of you; those guys were rough.\u201d\n\nMilitary school reinforced the strong work ethic and sense of discipline Trump had learned from his father. And it taught him how to deal with aggressive men, like his intimidating baseball coach, Theodore Dobias:\n\nWhat I did, basically, was to convey that I respected his authority, but that he didn\u2019t intimidate me. It was a delicate balance. Like so many strong guys, Dobias had a tendency to go for the jugular if he smelled weakness. On the other hand, if he sensed strength but you didn\u2019t try to undermine him, he treated you like a man.\n\nTrump has never forgotten the lesson he learned from his father and from his teachers at the academy: The world is a dangerous place. You have to be ready to fight. The same lesson was reinforced in the greatest tragedy that Trump has heretofore known\u2014the death of his older brother at age 43. Freddy Trump was never able to thrive in the competitive environment that his father created. Described by Blair in The Trumps as \u201ctoo much the sweet lightweight, a mawkish but lovable loser,\u201d Freddy failed to impress his father in the family business and eventually became an airline pilot. Alcoholism contributed to his early death. Donald, who doesn\u2019t drink, loved his brother and grieved when he died. \u201cFreddy just wasn\u2019t a killer,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s own words from a 1981 People interview, the fundamental backdrop for his life narrative is this: \u201cMan is the most vicious of all animals, and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat.\u201d The protagonist of this story is akin to what the great 20th-century scholar and psychoanalyst Carl Jung identified in myth and folklore as the archetypal warrior. According to Jung, the warrior\u2019s greatest gifts are courage, discipline, and skill; his central life task is to fight for what matters; his typical response to a problem is to slay it or otherwise defeat it; his greatest fear is weakness or impotence. The greatest risk for the warrior is that he incites gratuitous violence in others, and brings it upon himself.\n\nTrump loves boxing and football, and once owned a professional football team. In the opening segment of The Apprentice, he welcomes the television audience to a brutal Darwinian world:\n\nNew York. My city. Where the wheels of the global economy never stop turning. A concrete metropolis of unparalleled strength and purpose that drives the business world. Manhattan is a tough place. This island is the real jungle. If you\u2019re not careful, it can chew you up and spit you out. But if you work hard, you can really hit it big, and I mean really big.\n\nThe story here is not so much about making money. As Trump has written, \u201cmoney was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.\u201d The story instead is about coming out on top.\n\nAs president, Donald Trump promises, he would make America great again. In Crippled America, he says that a first step toward victory is building up the armed forces: \u201cEverything begins with a strong military. Everything.\u201d The enemies facing the United States are more terrifying than those the hero has confronted in Queens and Manhattan. \u201cThere has never been a more dangerous time,\u201d Trump says. Members of isis \u201care medieval barbarians\u201d who must be pursued \u201crelentlessly wherever they are, without stopping, until every one of them is dead.\u201d Less frightening but no less belligerent are our economic competitors, like the Chinese. They keep beating us. We have to beat them.\n\nAndrew Jackson displayed many of the same psychological qualities that we see in Trump.\n\nEconomic victory is one thing; starting and winning real wars is quite another. In some ways, Trump appears to be less prone to military action than certain other candidates. He has strongly criticized George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, and has cautioned against sending American troops to Syria.\n\nThat said, I believe there is good reason to fear Trump\u2019s incendiary language regarding America\u2019s enemies. David Winter, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, analyzed U.S. presidential inaugural addresses and found that those presidents who laced their speeches with power-oriented, aggressive imagery were more likely than those who didn\u2019t to lead the country into war. The rhetoric that Trump uses to characterize both his own life story and his attitudes toward America\u2019s foes is certainly aggressive. And, as noted, his extroversion and narcissism suggest a willingness to take big risks\u2014actions that history will remember. Tough talk can sometimes prevent armed conflict, as when a potential adversary steps down in fear. But belligerent language may also incite nationalistic anger among Trump\u2019s supporters, and provoke the rival nations at whom Trump takes aim.\n\nAcross the world\u2019s cultures, warrior narratives have traditionally been about and for young men. But Trump has kept this same kind of story going throughout his life. Even now, as he approaches the age of 70, he is still the warrior. Going back to ancient times, victorious young combatants enjoyed the spoils of war\u2014material bounty, beautiful women. Trump has always been a big winner there. His life story in full tracks his strategic maneuvering in the 1970s, his spectacular victories (the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Trump Tower) in the 1980s, his defeats in the early 1990s, his comeback later in that same decade, and the expansion of his brand and celebrity ever since. Throughout it all, he has remained the ferocious combatant who fights to win.\n\nBut what broader purpose does winning the battle serve? What higher prize will victory secure? Here the story seems to go mute. You can listen all day to footage of Donald Trump on the campaign trail, you can read his books, you can watch his interviews\u2014and you will rarely, if ever, witness his stepping back from the fray, coming home from the battlefront, to reflect upon the purpose of fighting to win\u2014whether it is winning in his own life, or winning for America.\n\nTrump\u2019s persona as a warrior may inspire some Americans to believe that he will indeed be able to make America great again, whatever that may mean. But his narrative seems thematically underdeveloped compared with those lived and projected by previous presidents, and by his competitors. Although his candidacy never caught fire, Marco Rubio told an inspiring story of upward mobility in the context of immigration and ethnic pluralism. Ted Cruz boasts his own Horatio Alger narrative, ideologically grounded in a profoundly conservative vision for America. The story of Hillary Clinton\u2019s life journey, from Goldwater girl to secretary of state, speaks to women\u2019s progress\u2014her election as president would be historic. Bernie Sanders channels a narrative of progressive liberal politics that Democrats trace back to the 1960s, reflected both in his biography and in his policy positions. To be sure, all of these candidates are fighters who want to win, and all want to make America great (again). But their life stories tell Americans what they may be fighting for, and what winning might mean.\n\nTrump has never forgotten the lesson from his father: The world is a dangerous place. You have to be ready to fight.\n\nVictories have given Trump\u2019s life clarity and purpose. And he must relish the prospect of another big win, as the potential GOP nominee. But what principles for governing can be drawn from a narrative such as his? What guidance can such a story provide after the election, once the more nebulous challenge of actually being the president of the United States begins?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s story\u2014of himself and of America\u2014tells us very little about what he might do as president, what philosophy of governing he might follow, what agenda he might lay out for the nation and the world, where he might direct his energy and anger. More important, Donald Trump\u2019s story tells him very little about these same things.\n\nNearly two centuries ago, President Andrew Jackson displayed many of the same psychological characteristics we see in Donald Trump\u2014the extroversion and social dominance, the volatile temper, the shades of narcissism, the populist authoritarian appeal. Jackson was, and remains, a controversial figure in American history. Nonetheless, it appears that Thomas Jefferson had it wrong when he characterized Jackson as completely unfit to be president, a dangerous man who choked on his own rage. In fact, Jackson\u2019s considerable success in dramatically expanding the power of the presidency lay partly in his ability to regulate his anger and use it strategically to promote his agenda.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Jackson personified a narrative that inspired large parts of America and informed his presidential agenda. His life story appealed to the common man because Jackson himself was a common man\u2014one who rose from abject poverty and privation to the most exalted political position in the land. Amid the early rumblings of Southern secession, Jackson mobilized Americans to believe in and work hard for the Union. The populism that his detractors feared would lead to mob rule instead connected common Americans to a higher calling\u2014a sovereign unity of states committed to democracy. The Frenchman Michel Chevalier, a witness to American life in the 1830s, wrote that the throngs of everyday people who admired Jackson and found sustenance and substance for their own life story in his \u201cbelong to history, they partake of the grand; they are the episodes of a wondrous epic which will bequeath a lasting memory to posterity, that of the coming of democracy.\u201d\n\nWho, really, is Donald Trump? What\u2019s behind the actor\u2019s mask? I can discern little more than narcissistic motivations and a complementary personal narrative about winning at any cost. It is as if Trump has invested so much of himself in developing and refining his socially dominant role that he has nothing left over to create a meaningful story for his life, or for the nation. It is always Donald Trump playing Donald Trump, fighting to win, but never knowing why.\n\nRelated Video", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/"}}
