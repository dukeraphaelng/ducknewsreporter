REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nHere is a look at how the crowds of protesters, many wearing the marches\u2019 signature pink hats, shaped up in some of the largest cities in North America:\n\n* WASHINGTON D.C.\n\nOrganizers of the march in the nation\u2019s capital had told police they expected 200,000 people to attend, but reporters covering the event said it appeared bigger than that, with a dense crowd stretching for about a mile (1.6 km) through the heart of the capital. Organizers said early estimates pointed to more than 1 million, while police and the Park Service declined to give numbers.\n\nCrowds pushed the Metro subway system to its limits, with some end-of-line stations temporarily turning away riders when parking lots filled and platforms became too crowded.\n\nSpeakers included the feminist writer Gloria Steinem and some of the country\u2019s biggest celebrities were in attendance, including actress Scarlett Johansson and pop singer Madonna. John Kerry, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state until this week, walked his dog alongside marchers on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n* LOS ANGELES\n\nLos Angeles hosted one of the largest marches, with organizers pinning the crowd at 750,000 and Los Angeles police saying it was as big or bigger than the 2006 pro-immigration march that drew 500,000. People packed into six blocks running up to City Hall and an overflow crowd spilled onto other streets in downtown L.A.\n\nSinger Miley Cyrus and Mayor Eric Garcetti were among the dozens of Hollywood celebrities and dignitaries, many of whom marched behind a vanguard of women motorcyclists clad in black leather.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I believe the future of our country demands participation at a level we have let slide for too long,\u201d said Kristy Peterson, a 37-year-old educational consultant who wore an American flag like a cape and a pink hat knitted by her mother.\n\n* NEW YORK CITY\n\nSome 400,000 people filled Midtown Manhattan, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. They marched from the United Nations headquarters along 42nd Street and up Fifth Avenue to Trump Tower, the president\u2019s residence and business headquarters before he moved to the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartened by the turnout and all the sister marches across the world,\u201d Megan Schulz, a 42-year-old director of communications from Brooklyn, said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\n* CHICAGO\n\nPolice said between 125,000 and 150,000 marchers gathered on an unseasonably warm day in Grant Park, the site of Barack Obama\u2019s victory rally in 2008 after he won the presidential election that year. Organizers put the number at 200,000. Speakers included Muslim leaders and activists for immigrant and transgender rights. Officials closed access to the park once it became full and organizers suspended a planned march through the city\u2019s downtown area because of the crowd\u2019s size, though some marched on anyway.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t stand by and let him work his negative ways on this county,\u201d Constance Cameron, a 68-year-old high-school English teacher, said.\n\n* BOSTON\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the best-known figures of the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal wing, joined Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and U.S. Senator Edward Markey at Boston Common.\n\n\u201cWe are here, we will not be silent, we will not play dead, we will fight for what we believe in,\u201d Warren told a crowd estimated at 120,000 to 125,000 people, according to CNN, which cited a senior police official. Organizers estimated 200,000 people.\n\n* DENVER\n\nIn the Mile-High City, a crowd estimated at 100,000 gathered at Civic Center Park near the state capitol for a day of speech-making and musical performance. It was the largest of 13 rallies scheduled across the state of Colorado.\n\n* TORONTO\n\nA peaceful crowd of marchers headed to City Hall of the Canadian city and onwards to the U.S. consulate building, with a police supervisor estimating that between 10,000 and 13,000 people were in attendance. An all-female list of speakers included indigenous elders and activists, while an effigy of Trump was left in battered shape by a group of school-age girls.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women-cities-factbox-idUSKBN1550VB"}, "article2": {"title": "Celebrities who promised to leave America if Trump won the election decide to stay", "content": "It is the first broken promise of the incoming Trump administration - and he didn't even make it.\n\nCelebrities who had said they would quit America if he won have abandoned their promises before President-elect Donald Trump is even inaugurated.\n\nSome dismissed what they pledged as a 'joke' and others simply went to ground when asked by DailyMail.com when they were packing up and heading to Canada or other countries.\n\nThe wave of celebrity U-turns was led by Madonna who abandoned a promise to perform sex acts on men who voted for Clinton before the polls even opened.\n\nIt is not known if anyone has complained about their disappointment to the multimillionaire liberal singer, 58, over her volte face.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe wave of celebrity U-turns was led by Madonna who abandoned a promise to perform sex acts on men who voted for Clinton before the polls even opened\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump paid Barack Obama a visit on Thursday at the White House. Celebrities who had said they would quit America if he won have abandoned their promises before he is even inaugurated\n\nOthers ditching their plans include Whoopi Goldberg, 60, who said on Thursday morning that 'I'm not leaving the country I was born and raised in,' and Amy Schumer, 35, who used social media to hit back at people telling her to pack her bags and declared her pledge to go was a 'joke'.\n\nActress and singer Miley Cyrus, 23, announced plans to leave the country in March but issued a tearful video the morning after Trump's win saying she 'accepted' the 70-year-old as her president.\n\nMore, however, have simply gone quiet, including Chloe Sevigny and Ne-Yo.\n\nQuite why so many celebrity would-be emigrants have seemingly decided not to up sticks is unclear, although financial circumstances may have provided a motivation.\n\nIn Canada, the destination of choice for many of those apparently desperate to leave, the top rate of income tax is 33 per cent \u2013 slightly less than the 39.6 per cent paid in federal tax by top earners in the US.\n\nTrump has said he will chop the top rate to 33 per cent - meaning there is no financial benefit to fleeing to Canada, although, of course, none of the celebrities had suggested they were moving for tax reasons.\n\nAnd celebrities would lose money if they escape to Britain, another favorite destination for Trump refugees. The nation has a top rate of 45 per cent - while Spain and Italy, both mentioned by A-listers contemplating a move, make high earners pay top rates of 45 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.\n\nSouth Africa, another destination mentioned by stars on the move, has a top rate of 41 percent \u2013 and a president, in Jacob Zuma, who is mired in a succession of corruption scandals.\n\nAlthough it is unclear how many votes Trump acquired in anticipation of mass departures, trolling would-be celebrity emigrants has become a popular pastime in recent days.\n\nBut not every limousine liberal celebrity promised to leave however.\n\nOne star who insisted he would stay was screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who said he would remain in the US - but failed to mention his double conviction for drug possession.\n\nHis pair of felony convictions mean he would need special permission from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just to cross the border.\n\nAnd Lady Gaga, who wept in her Rolls Royce after staging a one woman protest outside Trump Tower in the early hours of Wednesday morning, is another who has never said she would quit the US.\n\nLady Gaga mourns the election result from within her Rolls Royce after staging a protest outside Trump Tower in New York\n\nBut others, among them Dunham, could still make the move \u2013 and are yet to confirm or deny their travel plans.\n\nDunham was not at her $4.8m home in the most expensive part of Brooklyn nor at her $2.8m West Hollywood house when DailyMail.com visited - and her spokesman said she was not available for comment.\n\nSo will Dunham and co ever actually leave? Here is DailyMail.com's guide to who is staying\u2026 and who really could be making the move north.\n\nAmy Schumer\n\n'Anyone saying pack your bags is just as disgusting as anyone who voted for this racist homophobic openly disrespectful woman abuser,' Schumer said after Trump won\n\nNet worth: Schumer earned $17 million last year according to Forbes\n\nWhat she said: 'My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish. Because I will move to Spain or somewhere,' comedian Schumer declared in a BBC Newsnight interview in September.\n\n'It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's just too crazy,' she went on.\n\nNow she says: Schumer, her bluff called, released a tearful statement on Instagram and described her intention to leave as a 'joke'.\n\n'First of all the interview where I said I would move was in London and was said in jest,' she said. 'Not that anyone needs more than a headline to count something as official news.'\n\nShe continued: 'Anyone saying pack your bags is just as disgusting as anyone who voted for this racist homophobic openly disrespectful woman abuser. Like the rest of us I am grieving today. My heart is in a million pieces. My heart breaks for my niece and my friends who are pregnant bringing children into the world right now.'\n\nWhat her people say: Nothing. Representatives for Schumer refused to respond to DailyMail.com's calls and emails.\n\nLena Dunham\n\n'I know a lovely place in Vancouver, and I can get my work done from there,' Dunham, 30, said in April. She has still to end hopes she could move there.\n\nNet worth: $12 million as of last year, according to Celebrity Net Worth\n\nWhat she said: 'I know a lovely place in Vancouver, and I can get my work done from there,' Dunham, 30, declared to the Hollywood Reporter at the Matrix Awards in New York in April.\n\n'I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,' she added.\n\nNow she says: Nothing - to the DailyMail.com at least. But in a 1,779 word jeremiad for her Lenny Letter sent early Friday morning, the Girls star complained that she had expected to be 'knocking back glasses of champagne creating a story to tell my unborn children'.\n\n'Maybe I\u2019d even get close enough to Hillary Clinton to hug her, to whisper \u201cThank you\"', she speculated.\n\nBut it was not to be, and Dunham now faces calls to make good on her promise.\n\nNot everyone is thrilled about the prospect - including the Canadians, with one Twitter user promising to 'take back' Justin Bieber if Dunham stays in the US.\n\nWhat her people say: Nothing. Dunham's spokespeople refused to respond to requests for comment. She was not available at either of her multi-million dollar homes.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg\n\n'I'm not leaving the country that I was born and raised in,' Whoopi said.

I don't want it to be America. Maybe it's time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go. I've always been an American, and this has always been my country and we've always been able to have discussions.\n\n'And suddenly now it's turning into, you know, not them, not them,' she said on The View in January.\n\nWhat she says now: Speaking on The View on Wednesday morning, the actress and TV host insisted that she's in the US to stay.\n\n'I'm not leaving the country that I was born and raised in,' she said. 'You don't get to tell me that I'm going.'\n\nWhat her people say: Goldberg's publicist told DailyMail.com that reports she planned to leave were 'not accurate at all' \u2013 pointing to an April episode of The View in which Goldberg said 'I'm not going anywhere at all'.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson\n\n'If that motherf****r becomes president I will move my black ass to South Africa,' Jackson swore\n\nNet worth: $170 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth\n\nHe said: 'If that motherf****r becomes president I will move my black ass to South Africa.' His claim was made on a Jimmy Kimmel sketch in December 2015.\n\nNow he says: On Thursday, Jackson, 67, used Twitter to announce that he plans to stay \u2013 although not before a number of South African newspapers ran breathless articles asking when the actor would be arriving.\n\nBut Jackson said: 'When you learn the difference between My Actual Opinion & A Kimmel Skit... Maybe we can talk. Till then, I'm Barbed Wire Up Your Asses!! [sic]'\n\nFor good measure, the Django Unchained star lambasted Trump and his supporters and compared the Republican victory to the introduction of the Jim Crow laws which enforced segregation.\n\n'The Last Time I survived Jim Crow I was Poor,' he wrote, adding: 'Guess what MOTHERF****S.. Not This Time!! Enjoy your newfound win, Bigly!!'\n\nWhat his people say: Nothing.

I feel sad for the young. [Trump] will never be more than the toilet, I've used as a symbol 4 Him. U Can't Polish [a t***].'\n\nOn Wednesday night, she took part in protests outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, calling them 'peaceful' and saying 'they [protesters] will not go gently In2 [sic] America's Dark Nite.'\n\nHowever, Cher is yet to address the question of leaving.\n\nWhat her people say: Nothing. They refused all requests to clarify her future living situation.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook immediately after the results were announced, a tearful Cyrus said she would 'accept' Trump as her president.\n\nNet worth: $160 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth\n\nShe said: 'We're all just f*****g jam between his rich ass toes.

And so Donald Trump, I accept you,' she said.\n\n'And this hurts to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that's fine, that's fine because I think now I want to be a hopeful hippie. But please just treat people with love and treat people compassion and treat people with respect and I will do the same for you.'\n\nCyrus, who is also yet to address the question of whether she will stay in the US, posted a second video on Thursday morning in which she said she had finished crying and vowed to continue Hillary Clinton's work via her own Happy Hippie non-profit foundation.\n\nShe said: 'As a reaction to this shocking election Happy Hippie and I are launching out newest campaign #HopefulHippie and to do this myself and Happy Hippie are putting education for young people at the very top of our list of priorities in honor, of course, Hillary Clinton.'\n\nHer people say: Nothing.

Alright,' when told it was time for him to 'pony up and head for the border'.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who was accused of racism in March after saying he only booked 'the whitest guy I can find' when choosing a golf caddy also vented his spleen at the Natural Resources Defense Council's annual Night of Comedy on Wednesday.\n\nTalking about new First Lady Melania Trump, he said: 'First of all, if you're going to be in this country, I think you need to speak English. I think that's one of the reasons there's so much intolerance, is that Melania does not.'\n\nImitating Slovenian-born Mrs Trump's accent, he continued: 'I will fight the bully of the cyber.'
