{"foreign_id": "35_Fake", "article1": {"title": "One of Donald Trump's Most Ardent Defenders is Dallas Pastor Robert Jeffress", "content": "Here\u2019s Robert Jeffress, talking to the hundreds of thousands of people watching conservative cable news on a typical Friday evening, and he\u2019s defending President Donald Trump against the latest array of accusations in the news this week. And he isn\u2019t simply defending Trump\u2014he\u2019s defending him with one carefully crafted Bible-wrapped barb after another, and with more passion, more preparation, more devotion than anyone else on television.\n\nAs Lou Dobbs finishes his opening remarks, Jeffress laughs and nods. It\u2019s early January, about two weeks into what will prove to be the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are missing paychecks, worrying about mortgages, car payments, utility bills. Some have started going to food banks. But Dobbs waves his hand up and down and tells Jeffress that he hasn\u2019t heard anyone\u2014\u201cliterally no one!\u201d\u2014say they miss the government. The jowly host revels in Trump\u2019s threats that the shutdown could continue \u201cfor months, if not years,\u201d if that\u2019s what it takes to get more wall built on America\u2019s border with Mexico.\n\nJeffress, speaking from a remote studio in downtown Dallas, agrees completely. \u201cWell, he\u2019s doing exactly the right thing in keeping this government shut down until he gets that wall,\u201d he says.\n\nJeffress is the senior pastor at First Baptist Dallas, a 13,000-member megachurch that\u2019s one of the most influential in the country, but he\u2019s known best for appearances like this one: he\u2019s often on Fox & Friends or Hannity or any number of sound-bitey segments on Fox News or Fox Business. His own religious show airs six days a week on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. He has a daily radio program too, broadcast on more than nine hundred Christian stations across the country, though it\u2019s TV he loves best. Dobbs invites Jeffress onto his show nearly every week.\n\nPopular Videos Previous Next more\n\nJeffress preaching at First Baptist Dallas on April 1, 2018. First Baptist Dallas\n\nJeffress continues. He cites the Old Testament tale of Nehemiah, who was inspired by God to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. \u201cThe Bible says even heaven itself is gonna have a wall around it,\u201d Jeffress adds. \u201cNot everyone is gonna be allowed in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Dobbs buys this theological reasoning, but he\u2019s at least amused by it. \u201cWhat would be the point of those pearly gates if there weren\u2019t a wall, right?\u201d the host says with a Cheshire grin.\n\nThe pastor keeps going. \u201cWhat is immoral,\u201d he says, \u201cis for Democrats to continue to try to block this president from performing his God-given task of protecting this nation.\u201d\n\nThe 63-year-old Jeffress is trim and winsome, with a natural smile and a syrupy demeanor. Tonight he\u2019s wearing a charcoal suit and a gleaming magenta tie with matching pocket square. As he speaks, the screen behind him shows generic patriotic imagery. He has the syntax and enunciation of a champion debater and the certitude of someone who believes he gets his instructions directly from God.\n\nHe is known for leaning into controversy, whether it\u2019s declaring that Mormonism is \u201ca heresy from the pit of hell\u201d (which resulted in an extended public beef with Mitt Romney) or preaching a sermon titled \u201cWhy Gay Is Not Okay\u201d (which resulted in a protest outside his church) or having two hundred or so members of his choir and orchestra perform a rendition of a hymn called \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d at a concert in Washington, D.C. (which resulted in not one but two approving tweets from President Trump).\n\nHe is also known, of course, as one of the president\u2019s most avid and outspoken advocates. While other evangelical leaders were slow to get behind Trump\u2014James Dobson, for example, wondered about Trump\u2019s religiosity\u2014Jeffress campaigned with him before the 2016 primaries even started, before Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio flamed out. If some evangelicals who now back Trump fret that they\u2019ve entered into a Faustian bargain, for Jeffress it\u2019s a wholehearted embrace. It\u2019s become one of the most fascinating symbiotic relationships in modern politics: the pastor gets a national platform for his message and a leader who appoints conservative judges who will in turn restrict access to abortion; the president gets the support of evangelical voters he needs to win reelection, along with an energetic and effective promoter who can explain or excuse all manner of polarizing behavior.\n\nWhen the Access Hollywood tape leaked before the election and America heard Trump brag about grabbing women, Jeffress went on Fox News to say that the candidate\u2019s words were \u201ccrude, offensive, and indefensible, but they\u2019re not enough to make me vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nAfter the president said there were \u201csome very fine people on both sides\u201d of the deadly clash between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, Jeffress appeared on the Christian Broadcasting Network to say that Democrats were falsely painting Trump as a racist. \u201cRacism comes in all shapes, all sizes, and, yes, all colors,\u201d explained the pastor. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re going to denounce some racism, we ought to denounce all racism.\u201d\n\nWhen the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels announced that she\u2019d had a sexual encounter with Trump and was paid to keep quiet before the election, Jeffress explained in a Fox News debate with Juan Williams that evangelicals \u201cknew they weren\u2019t voting for an altar boy.\u201d\n\nJeffress defended Trump when the president referred to a kneeling NFL player as a \u201cson of a bitch.\u201d He justified the administration\u2019s separating children from their parents at the border. When Trump questioned why America would accept immigrants from \u201cshithole countries,\u201d Jeffress responded this way: \u201cApart from the vocabulary attributed to him, President Trump is right on target in his sentiment.\u201d\n\nTen days before tonight\u2019s appearance with Dobbs, Jeffress was on a different Fox show, scoffing at a Christmas tweet from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, suggesting that Jesus was a refugee. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the Biblical text to suggest that Mary, Joseph, and Jesus came to Egypt to flee Herod illegally,\u201d Jeffress said, laughing and shaking his head. \u201cAnd they certainly didn\u2019t come in a caravan of five thousand, threatening Egyptian sovereignty.\u201d\n\nNo doubt Jeffress knows that a lot of the people waiting at the border are there precisely because they want to enter legally, as asylum seekers, but that didn\u2019t come up on air. These television exchanges, usually over in five minutes, don\u2019t allow for such distinctions.\n\nDuring this evening\u2019s three-minute discussion with Dobbs, Jeffress sounds more like a fiery Old Testament prophet than a turn-the-other-cheek Christian: he decries Democrats for supporting sanctuary cities laws he believes led to the death of a police officer in California. He says Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib is \u201cdespicable\u201d for using \u201cgutter language to curse our president.\u201d He declares, \u201cThe Democrats are the party of immorality.\u201d He calls Romney a \u201cself-righteous snake.\u201d\n\nHis animated ranting earns a belly laugh from Dobbs. Finally, the host tells him, \u201cPastor, good to have you with us!\u201d\n\nWith that, the camera\u2019s off. After wiping away his TV makeup, Jeffress will walk out of the studio, drive to his home in North Dallas, and spend the rest of the evening watching TV with his wife, Amy. He may even watch a replay of tonight\u2019s show.\n\nTV reaches people, and reaching people is important to Jeffress. And to reach people, he knows, you must understand who they are and how they will hear you. You must be, as the Apostle Paul once put it, all things to all people.\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress as a boy in the sixties, well-mannered and bright, so infatuated with the power of television that he dreams of one day becoming\u2014of all things\u2014an executive producer on a TV show. He\u2019s so dedicated to this dream, so enthralled by show business, that he wakes up early some days to play his accordion before school on a children\u2019s morning show in Dallas called Mr. Peppermint.\n\nHis family lives in Richardson, but they spend plenty of time at First Baptist, downtown. It\u2019s a turbulent time for Dallas, where the president has just been assassinated, and for the church, which is reckoning with desegregation. First Baptist has always been enmeshed in politics: George Truett, who became pastor in 1897, gave his most famous sermon, about the separation of church and state, on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C. His successor, W. A. Criswell, is not shy either: He has decried the Supreme Court decision to desegregate schools as \u201cidiocy\u201d and suggested that Catholics do not make good presidents. In 1968 Criswell reverses his position on desegregation and is soon thereafter voted in as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. The move puts North Texas at the center of a massive conservative movement.\n\nHis ninth-grade speech teacher tells him, \u201cJeffress, you\u2019re going to be a preacher one day, and it scares the bejeebers out of me because you can sell anybody anything!\u201d\n\nYoung Robert absorbs all this. His parents campaign for Barry Goldwater in 1964. When he is fourteen, Roe v. Wade goes to court, just a short walk from First Baptist; he\u2019s seventeen when the Supreme Court legalizes access to abortion. In 1976 Criswell endorses Gerald Ford from the pulpit, but Jeffress casts his ballot\u2014his first\u2014for a Democrat, a born-again Christian from Georgia named Jimmy Carter.\n\nAlthough Jeffress is just a boy, people around him are already taking notice of his power to influence others. His ninth grade speech teacher tells him, \u201cJeffress, you\u2019re going to be a preacher one day, and it scares the bejeebers out of me because you can sell anybody anything!\u201d Criswell becomes his mentor, and in fact, when he\u2019s a freshman in high school, Jeffress hears God tell him to abandon his executive producer dreams.\n\nFor the first fifteen years of his career as a pastor, at a small church in Eastland and then a larger First Baptist in Wichita Falls, Jeffress doesn\u2019t get political. He rarely mentions abortion or homosexuality. But he learns the power of controversy in 1998, when a member of his church shows him two children\u2019s books from the local library: Heather Has Two Mommies and Daddy\u2019s Roommate. Jeffress announces that he will not allow the books to be returned. The city council takes his side, the American Civil Liberties Union sues the city, and the story makes national headlines. Eventually a court decides the library can keep the titles in the children\u2019s section, but by then Jeffress has received letters and donations from all over the country. Church attendance goes up, and soon comes an expensive new sanctuary.\n\nJeffress will remember these lessons when he is invited, in 2007, to return to First Baptist Dallas as senior pastor. In his first few years back, he gives sermons with attention-grabbing titles on the marquee and makes controversial statements about, in no particular order, Mormons, Muslims, Jews, Catholics, gays, lesbians, and Oprah Winfrey. Almost a decade later, he embraces one of the most controversial presidential candidates of all time, and in 2018 the church reports the highest giving levels in its 150-year history. Now, like Criswell and Billy Graham, who was himself a longtime member of First Baptist Dallas, Jeffress has the ear of the president.\n\nThrough all this, he retains his affinity for television. In 2018 his entire family is featured on a TLC reality show centered on his oldest daughter\u2019s newborn triplets. At First Baptist, the main sanctuary gets outfitted with six or seven high-definition screens that can be made into a long LED scroll that ribbons across the back of the proscenium. Sunday services are broadcast live on the church website, an operation that includes seven cameras, a team of grips and technicians, and a control room that rivals studios at CNN and Fox. The church posts his cable news clips on YouTube. Jeffress says TV accounts for a small percentage of his work but that Fox News\u2014where he becomes a paid contributor under contract\u2014is a \u201cgateway to bring people into our ministry.\u201d\n\nOlivier Douliery-Pool/Getty\n\nAnd television, it turns out, is how he connects to the president, a man with his own affinity for reality shows. In mid-2015, after seeing Jeffress compliment him on Fox News, Trump tweets out the clip and has someone from his office\u2014Jeffress doesn\u2019t remember who\u2014reach out so he can thank the pastor for the kind words.\n\nWhen Jeffress recounts the story, he lowers his voice an octave to repeat the way he\u2019s heard Trump describe it: \u201c \u2018You know, I was watching TV one night, and I\u2019ll never forget, I saw Pastor Jeffress saying, \u2018Trump\u2019s a lousy Christian, but he\u2019s a good leader. \u2019 \u201d\n\nThe pastor interrupts himself to clarify. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t quite say it that way,\u201d he explains, lest anyone think he called the president lousy. \u201cI said, \u2018He\u2019s not a perfect person, but he\u2019s a tremendous leader.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJeffress has also heard Trump tell it this way: \u201cI was watching television with Melania, and I saw Pastor Jeffress, and I said, \u2018Look at his mouth move! Look at how quickly that mouth moves. It\u2019s like a machine gun! I would never want to see that used against me someday!\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign asks Jeffress to pray at a rally in Dallas that fall, and soon the two forge what they describe as a friendship. The candidate sends nice notes or has his assistant email, and in early 2016, Trump invites Jeffress to join him on the campaign trail. The pastor spends a weekend with Trump in Iowa, where, both men understand, evangelical support can make or break a Republican presidential run. Jeffress says things like \u201cI don\u2019t want some meek and mild leader or somebody who\u2019s going to turn the other cheek. I\u2019ve said I want the meanest, toughest SOB I can find to protect this nation.\u201d\n\nThen Jeffress is at Trump Tower on the day of the election. The mood is not optimistic. Jeffress tells Trump he hopes they\u2019ll stay friends, no matter the outcome. Trump asks him if he thinks evangelical voters will show up for him. The pastor says he does. Later that night, Jeffress and his wife go to the Hilton to watch the results come in. For a while, it\u2019s slow and quiet, and the couple debate leaving early.\n\nBut as the evening wears on, the feeling in the room starts to change.\n\n\u201cI will never forget when the spotlight was thrown on the balcony of the ballroom,\u201d he recalls later, his voice slowing for dramatic effect. \u201cThe president and the first lady and their family entered to the soundtrack of the movie Air Force One. It was a chill-bumps moment.\u201d\n\nAfter a speech, Trump comes down from the stage to shake a few hands. Spotting Jeffress, he walks over and puts his arm around the pastor. The boy who used to play his accordion on Mr. Peppermint is now standing next to the future president. \u201cDid you see it?\u201d Trump says. \u201cLargest evangelical turnout in history!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I saw it,\u201d Jeffress tells him. \u201cI just wanted to be sure you saw it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress in his office, a year or so into Trump\u2019s first term, speaking to a reporter: me. We have a bit of history. In late 2011, around the time Jeffress was first upsetting conservatives by criticizing Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, I wrote a profile of Jeffress for D Magazine. In the story, I explained that despite the fact that I disagreed with him on virtually every issue\u2014at the time, he was supporting a presidential run by Texas governor Rick Perry\u2014I found Jeffress charming and personable. Yes, he insists that the vast majority of humanity will spend eternity in a pit of fire. But he\u2019s also self-deprecating and disarming. I was curious about his political advocacy and how he squares it with the teachings of Jesus.\n\nAfter the story ran, we continued to have lunch every couple of months, usually in his office. It\u2019s on the sixth floor of one of the church\u2019s eight buildings, with towering shelves of scholarly journals, framed covers of his books (he has written more than twenty), and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the Nasher Sculpture Center. We ask each other about family and work. We discuss news and politics and whatever\u2019s happening in the world that week.\n\nHe\u2019s completely engaged, attentive. With or without the TV makeup, he\u2019s the same man. Same rapid-fire delivery. Same polite, saccharine manner. Same unapologetic born-again Baptist view of the world. He says he genuinely wants me to dedicate myself to Jesus Christ, and he prays for me and my wife. His goal is to save as many souls as possible before the end times. He knows journalism is important to me, and he reminds me that some of the greatest writers in history were Christians. I joke that I know he\u2019d love to brag that he helped shape some sort of present-day C. S. Lewis.\n\nJeffress often tells his flock that God sends us tests and trials. I want to ask Jeffress if he thinks there\u2019s any chance Donald Trump is a test from God\u2014and if maybe he\u2019s failing.\n\nI\u2019m also forthright: about my curiosity, about my dismay at the many things he says and does that have the potential to hurt so many people. He knows what I\u2019m talking about, and he laughs and nods. We discuss my writing something about him and his friendship with the president. He likes the idea. Then he jokes, \u201cNow, don\u2019t pull a Michael Cohen on me!\u201d\n\nSo for months, I attend Sunday services, hang out at church events, spend hours talking politics with religious conservatives, and meet over and over with Jeffress himself. The unlikelihood of the Trump presidency has occasioned much ink and froth about the many purported reasons that white evangelicals supported him: economic and racial fears, Supreme Court picks, abortion, the fact that he wasn\u2019t Hillary Clinton, and so on. It\u2019s also provoked condemnation of Jeffress and his fellow Trump-supporting religious leaders for seemingly abandoning Christian principles in exchange for power\u2014for becoming \u201ccourt evangelicals,\u201d as historian John Fea, the author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump, puts it. Fresh-faced 2020 presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, a gay military veteran and a Christian, likes to say that support for Trump is in tension with much of the New Testament, including, for example, the way Jesus condemns those who truckle to the strong while neglecting the poor. Closer to home, Eric Folkerth, the senior pastor at the much more liberal Woods United Methodist Church, in Grand Prairie, writes an open letter to Jeffress in May, calling him \u201ca Pharisee of our time.\u201d\n\nAnd so I press Jeffress to explain the choices he makes, to explain the things he says in front of the cameras. Jeffress has told me he was drawn to Trump\u2019s leadership and intellect. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart person,\u201d he\u2019s said. \u201cYou don\u2019t become a billionaire and president of the United States by being an idiot.\u201d But none of that quite explains why a pastor goes out of his way to publicly defend the president\u2019s every indiscretion. He could easily vote according to his views on the Supreme Court or according to his conscience on abortion without also going on TV, over and over, in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers, to explain away things like Trump\u2019s adultery and language that inflames foreign policy. He could be in favor of immigration reform, for example, and not feel compelled to rationalize the separation of families. He could believe that God has put someone in power and still hold that person to a high moral standard.\n\nJeffress often tells his flock that God sends us tests and trials. I want to ask Jeffress if he thinks there\u2019s any chance Donald Trump is a test from God\u2014and if maybe he\u2019s failing.\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress on a Sunday morning, surrounded by lights and cameras and flat screens the size of school buses, taking the stage with the confident stride of a talk show host. He\u2019s looking out on an audience of roughly 1,600, with thousands more watching and listening in, delivering a sermon that\u2019s at turns funny and thoughtful and ripe with references to pop culture and historic events and scholarly interpretations of biblical passages. Jeffress is wearing a dark suit with faint pinstripes, a red tie that glimmers under the lights, and a nearly imperceptible wireless microphone over his right cheek, and he\u2019s nailing the timing of every joke and pausing for laughs and modulating his voice in just the right way to create connection.\n\nToday\u2019s sermon is about \u201cthe antidote to worry,\u201d and it unfolds like a forty-minute brimstone-scented TED talk. In the first few minutes alone, he mixes in quotes from obscure authors, anecdotes from World War II, and the etymology of the word \u201cworry.\u201d Sprinkled throughout are also copious references to supporting Scripture; there are more than ten, from the Old Testament and New, in the first twenty minutes. After each citation, he pauses to let his words linger. His reasoning is based on the fact that every word of the Bible is literally true.\n\nJeffress agrees with the popular comparison evangelicals draw between President Trump and Cyrus the Great, the ancient Persian king who, according to Jewish tradition, allowed the exiled Hebrews to return to Jerusalem. Cyrus is thought of as a secular agent of God\u2019s divine plan, and this oft-cited parallel is useful to Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic backers as a way of explaining their support: they can champion him, they say, because there is a difference between the earthly realm and the heavenly one, between government and church. In an interview with the Washington Post, Jerry Falwell Jr. put it this way: \u201cIn the heavenly kingdom, the responsibility is to treat others as you\u2019d like to be treated. In the earthly kingdom, the responsibility is to choose leaders who will do what\u2019s best for your country.\u201d\n\nBut keeping your realms separate is not so clear-cut when you\u2019re both a pundit and a pastor. Jeffress, unlike his peers, is the full-time shepherd of a flock. In the lustrous sanctuary of First Baptist\u2014the church has multiple six-story garages and crowded escalators and feels a little like one of the theaters or music halls a few blocks away in the Arts District\u2014Jeffress preaches two sermons nearly every Sunday. He attends luncheons and prayer meetings and Bible studies. He visits people in the hospital and performs weddings and funerals. He helped raise more than $135 million for a renovation that included a new children\u2019s building, sky bridges, and a dancing, LED-loaded fountain. At special events, visitors are given not a Bible but a copy of one of his books. \u201cHe is so right,\u201d one of his members, a black mother in her thirties, tells me. \u201cIt is time to stop being wimpy about Christianity. I wish more Christians had the heart for the Lord that he does.\u201d\n\nJeffress studiously insists that his politics and his pastorate are separate. \u201cWe don\u2019t check green cards or passports at First Baptist Dallas,\u201d he\u2019s fond of saying. When he\u2019s at the podium in church, he seldom utters a word about the president. And while some of the older men in the pews are wearing American flag and Israeli flag pins on their suits\u2014and there\u2019s at least one bumper sticker in the parking garage for QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory alleging a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot against Trump\u2014it\u2019s not like members are debating legislative policy in the halls. It\u2019s more that there\u2019s a general celebration and commingling of patriotism and piety. I recently attended services on and off for five months and never heard Jeffress mention politics explicitly in a sermon. I heard him talk about how heaven is a real place and what people do there: enjoy the relief of a job well done, share fellowship with loved ones, get to better know their Lord.\n\nThough First Baptist doesn\u2019t keep records on its racial demographics, the congregation seems as diverse as that of any megachurch in North Texas. Affluent older white people dressed in stiff suits and flowery dresses with matching hats. Young couples, the men in jeans and tucked-in button-downs, the women in cotton dresses. A black family spanning four generations. Immigrants from Latin America and Africa and Eastern Europe and East Asia. At the other end of the building, in a separate sanctuary, hundreds more people\u2014mostly younger\u2014watch Jeffress on a live broadcast.\n\nAbout twenty minutes into his sermon about worry, Jeffress says something that makes me perk up a bit. He\u2019s hoisting an open Bible in his left hand when his tone changes for just a moment, and he stares into the camera, his right hand gesturing to the breast of his pinstriped suit. \u201cI can tell you from personal experience: God\u2019s discipline is never pleasant,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are times in my life\u2014don\u2019t ask for details, I\u2019m not gonna give \u2019em to you\u2014but I can tell you, there are times that I have not been doing the right thing, and God put his heavy hand upon me. And I can tell you for sure, I never want to experience that again.\u201d\n\nHe explains that we don\u2019t have to experience God\u2019s discipline if we live our lives the right way. He makes another emphatic gesture with his right hand, this time with his thumb out in a way that evokes Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d he says, we can \u201cstart walking in a new direction.\u201d\n\nAs he always does, Jeffress invites anyone who wants to be saved to come forward and dedicate their life to Jesus Christ. His voice is soft. Even in a crowd of some 1,600 people, for a split second it can feel as if he\u2019s talking to you personally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that you\u2019re hearing my voice today,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen he\u2019s done this morning, there are at least a dozen people walking down the aisles, ready to be born again.\n\nRobert Jeffress at First Baptist Dallas on March 27, 2019. Photograph by Trevor Paulhus\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress in his office again, on a weekday afternoon in early fall. He\u2019s sitting flat-footed in a blue leather chair, wearing one of his usual dark suits and satiny ties, like he\u2019s ready to appear on camera at a moment\u2019s notice, should the need arise. I\u2019m sitting at the end of a big leather couch, a few feet away, with my recorder between us.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the distinction he makes between what he considers spiritual and political. I want to know if it\u2019s really tenable, if it\u2019s really honest. On Twitter, he promotes his sermons and events at the church right next to his appearances on Fox News. When his choir performed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d in D.C., it was a de facto Trump rally\u2014and now the song is in the church hymn database. He doesn\u2019t just invite Fox personalities like Sean Hannity and politicians like Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott into his sanctuary; the church often uses their appearances as bring-a-friend promotions.\n\nOur conversations over the months often return to this topic, and he agrees it\u2019s an important one.\n\n\u201cIf someone asks me to talk on a subject,\u201d he says, \u201cI ask myself the first question: Does the Bible have a particular point of view on this?\u201d\n\nThe Bible has a point of view on many things, he explains. Some things, like capital punishment or whether a country\u2019s leader has a right to defend its borders, he thinks, are clear. Other issues, like marginal tax rates and public health-care policy, are less clear. And besides, when Hannity was there to promote a Christian movie, they didn\u2019t say much about politics at all.\n\nWhat about when you call Democrats the \u201cparty of immorality\u201d? I ask. Isn\u2019t that crossing the line into politics?\n\n\u201cI think, in a lot of ways, the Republican party is just as spiritually bankrupt as the Democratic party, but at least at this point in time they are championing some moral principles like the right to life and the right of religious liberty.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting equivocation, and I\u2019m reminded how, in our exchanges, he has emphatically insisted that he\u2019s not a Republican or a Democrat. He has also told me his congregation has plenty of Democrats, though I haven\u2019t met one. When I ask him if he\u2019d ever invite a Democrat or someone from CNN to speak at his church, he laughs.\n\n\u201cYou know, I would have to think about it,\u201d he says. Then he adds, \u201cBut if we haven\u2019t, it\u2019s not because they are Democrats. It\u2019s because of the point of view they would articulate on these basic core spiritual issues. I mean, try to find me a pro-life Democrat leader. You can\u2019t find one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasic core spiritual issues\u201d is usually his answer when I press him on why he goes out of his way, again and again, to defend Trump. He cares about religious liberty\u2014which for him essentially boils down to whether churches and businesses should be required to provide birth control for employees and whether businesses can deny service to gay or trans people. And nearly every policy discussion eventually comes back to what he sees as the national battle that started in Dallas when he was a teenager. He believes Roe v. Wade, not the issue of sexual assault or of judicial temperament, was at the heart of the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The Democrats were worried that Kavanaugh\u2019s rulings would \u201csomehow lessen the number of babies being murdered every year in the womb through abortion.\u201d\n\nGun rights is one of the two main issues on which he disagrees with the Republican party. The other is health care. He has been a vocal critic of Obamacare, but Jeffress does tell me, \u201cThe GOP is on the wrong side of this.\u201d\n\nThis is why Trump is the sort of warrior evangelicals have long craved, a warrior who will fight for their beliefs regardless of whether he holds those beliefs himself. This is why Jeffress doesn\u2019t worry about Trump\u2019s personal behavior. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a war, you don\u2019t worry about style,\u201d he explains. \u201cNobody would have criticized General Patton because of his language. We\u2019re in a war here between good and evil. And to me, the president\u2019s tone, his demeanor, just aren\u2019t issues I choose to get involved with.\u201d (When I look this up later, I learn that some top commanders and many members of Congress did criticize\u2014and discipline\u2014General Patton for verbally abusing and slapping two soldiers. He was suspended from his command and made to apologize.)\n\nI ask Jeffress why, since he believes all sin is equal, abortion is more important than every other issue. Criswell, his mentor, and other past religious leaders didn\u2019t feel nearly as strongly about the topic. Criswell stated publicly that life begins at birth and didn\u2019t change his stance until after the widespread use of ultrasound technology. \u201cCriswell and other evangelicals were just ignorant of the science,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the ability to view a life inside the womb as we do today and understand that that\u2019s a real, live human being.\u201d\n\nWhat about children at the border and the administration\u2019s policy of separating families? Doesn\u2019t he think we should protect babies at our borders too?\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he tells me, \u201cif you have a woman who is convicted of a bank robbery and she has an infant child and she\u2019s sent to prison, I mean, her baby is going to be ripped from her.\u201d\n\nBut of course, we have gradations of crimes in this country, and crossing a border\u2014even if it\u2019s illegal\u2014is a far different thing than robbing a bank. This policy was instituted as a deterrent. I remind him that many people, including some Baptists, believe it\u2019s a callous way to treat children.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t secure our borders, we\u2019re enticing the needy people, the persecuted people, to make a dangerous journey to come to this country or try to enter illegally, and I think, in part, we are morally responsible for doing that,\u201d he tells me. He compares it to laws that hold homeowners responsible when a child strays into an unfenced pool and drowns. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to secure our borders and at the same time deal equitably and justly with people who want to enter this country for legitimate reasons.\u201d\n\nI bring up some other children: the survivors of mass shootings. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, in Parkland, Florida, when students organized marches across the country to protest U.S. gun laws, Jeffress told Fox News viewers that changing the laws would not help because laws couldn\u2019t change the evil in someone\u2019s heart\u2014though maybe displaying the Ten Commandments in schools could. Talking with me, though, he admits that mass shootings weigh on him heavily. He points out that, in Genesis, the primary reason God floods the earth is violence. \u201cGod hates those who harm others,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Bible or even the Constitution gives a unilateral, unconditional, unrestrained right for guns. The government has a right and responsibility to control that.\u201d\n\nGun rights, in fact, is one of the two main issues on which he disagrees with the Republican party. The other is health care. He has been a vocal critic of Obamacare, but Jeffress does tell me, \u201cThe GOP is on the wrong side of this.\u201d He says, \u201cThere ought to be a safety net\u201d and \u201cAmericans want coverage for preexisting conditions\u201d and that \u201cbefore we dismantle something, we ought to have something better ready in its place.\u201d\n\nI ask Jeffress if he\u2019d be critical of, say, someone like Democratic senator Cory Booker, if the public learned he\u2019d had an affair with a porn star.\n\n\u201cI have to be consistent,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd consistent would say that my objection to Cory Booker would not be his personal life but his public policies.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress in January 2016, sitting on Trump\u2019s plane between campaign stops in Iowa, and the pastor and the presidential candidate are finishing their lunch of Wendy\u2019s cheeseburgers when Jeffress says, \u201cMr. Trump, I believe you\u2019re going to be the next president of the United States. And if that happens, it\u2019s because God has a great purpose for you and for our nation.\u201d Jeffress quotes from the book of Daniel, chapter two, and explains, \u201cGod is the one who establishes kings and removes kings.\u201d\n\nTrump looks at the pastor and says, \u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I do,\u201d Jeffress says.\n\nTrump asks, \u201cDo you believe God ordained Obama to be president?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Jeffress tells Trump. \u201cGod has a purpose for every leader.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly not the way Jeffress talked about Barack Obama when he was president. Jeffress wasn\u2019t a fan. Shortly before Mitt Romney secured the Republican nomination in 2012, Jeffress said he\u2019d \u201chold [his] nose\u201d and vote for him instead of Obama, despite believing that Mormonism is a cult and Romney is going to hell. (He\u2019s also said that Jews, Hindus, Muslims, and nonbelievers are destined for hell.) He criticized both Obamacare and National Security Agency surveillance as violations of Americans\u2019 freedom. In 2014, citing Obama\u2019s support for same-sex marriage, Jeffress declared that the president was \u201cpaving the way for the Antichrist.\u201d\n\nJeffress very much believes that an Antichrist will rise to power one day\u2014possibly soon\u2014before Jesus returns to earth. This isn\u2019t entirely surprising. After graduating from Baylor, he attended Dallas Theological Seminary, a hub of twentieth-century dispensational theology, where he was taught, and embraced, the idea that God reveals himself progressively through different dispensations, or ages, and that these would culminate in an epic showdown between Christ and a fearsome enemy. Key events of this apocalypse would occur in Israel, went the thinking, and it was common for dispensationalists to publicly identify people they thought might be the Antichrist. Henry Kissinger was a popular pick; so was Mikhail Gorbachev, whose prominent birthmark looked suspiciously, to some, like the mark of the beast. Eventually most religious figures stopped trying to identify the Antichrist and the exact date of Christ\u2019s return, but they didn\u2019t stop believing that the supernatural confrontation was imminent.\n\nAt one point, not long after Trump meets with Kim Jong-un and it feels like we might be closer to nuclear annihilation than we have been in half a century, I ask Jeffress, mostly as a joke, whether evangelicals support this president because they secretly think he\u2019s hastening the end times and the return of Jesus.\n\nJeffress lets out a quick chirp of a laugh. Actually, he explains, a lot of evangelicals view Trump as a brief reprieve from a downward moral spiral: everything from the removal of Ten Commandments monuments to restrictions on prayer in schools to the ways our culture flaunts sex and corrupts minds. He\u2019s under no illusion that the Democrats won\u2019t return to power again one day. Trump, he says, is a way to push in the other direction, if only temporarily.\n\nHe anticipates my follow-up.\n\n\u201cWhy would Christians want to put off the return of Christ?\u201d he asks. \u201cTo give us more time to save people.\u201d\n\nThe truth for him personally, though, is that he also just likes Trump. Jeffress insists that theirs isn\u2019t just a quid-pro-quo sort of friendship, a calculated, cynical partnership. He says he genuinely enjoys Trump\u2019s company. He\u2019d like to think they\u2019d be friends regardless of the presidency.\n\nJeffress says Trump isn\u2019t as impulsive as he might seem. He says the president has told him how he workshops insulting nicknames he plans to call opponents on Twitter. He says he watched as Trump agonized at the White House over what to do about DACA recipients. He\u2019s seen the president demonstrate diligence and control, unlike the raging character often depicted in the press.\n\nSeveral times in our conversation, Jeffress plays it a little safer and parses his words, saying that he and the president \u201caren\u2019t bosom buddies.\u201d Is he protecting himself in case one day his association with Trump becomes toxic?\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to be as accurate as possible.\u201d\n\nA few months after his inauguration, Trump boasts about issuing an executive order instructing the Department of the Treasury not to pursue religious organizations when they violate the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits nonprofits from making partisan political statements, a restriction Jeffress has spoken out against for more than a decade. Then, in May 2018, the Trump administration does something even more important for evangelicals: it officially relocates the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, much of which is regarded under international law as occupied territory.\n\nJeffress, the lifelong dispensationalist, is invited to give the opening prayer at the new embassy\u2019s dedication. He\u2019s there, in Jerusalem, standing at the lectern with his eyes closed. He\u2019s just feet from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner\u2014all Jewish, all going to hell in Jeffress\u2019s view, all sitting together in the front row.\n\nAfter thanking God for the blessing and protection of Israel, and for the work of both Netanyahu and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jeffress thanks God for the \u201ctremendous leadership\u201d of Donald Trump. \u201cWithout President Trump\u2019s determination, resolve, and courage, we would not be here today,\u201d Jeffress says. \u201cWe thank you every day that you have given us a president who boldly stands on the right side of history but, more importantly, stands on the right side of you, O God, when it comes to Israel.\u201d\n\nA few months after that, in August, the White House hosts an elaborate dinner for a hundred or so evangelical leaders from across the country. Franklin Graham is there. So are James Dobson and Paula White, a TV host and pastor of a Florida megachurch. Jeffress is one of the preachers Trump thanks by name.\n\nReading prepared remarks, the president lists his evangelical-friendly accomplishments: issuing orders limiting government funding for groups that provide abortions, helping to free an American pastor being held in Turkey, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Of course, there\u2019s no record of him mentioning any of these issues before campaigning for president and meeting people like Jeffress.\n\nAt the end of his short speech, Trump thanks the religious leaders. He calls them \u201cspecial people.\u201d Then he looks up from his script.\n\n\u201cThe support you\u2019ve given me has been incredible,\u201d the president says. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t feel guilty, because I have given you a lot back.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Robert Jeffress at a Maggiano\u2019s in North Dallas, standing in front of two hundred or so people at an event called Dinner With the Pastor. Every few months, prospective church members are invited to have a meal and conversation in a private room, all on First Baptist\u2019s tab. The massive serving plates on each table are full of ravioli slathered in cream, balsamic-glazed chicken, and meaty lasagna. There are Frisbee-size cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es and gallons of iced tea. The highlight of the evening, though, is when attendees are invited to ask the pastor anything they want.\n\nOne woman says she campaigned for Trump and wants to know if Jeffress really told him he knew he would be president. Jeffress recounts the conversation they had over Wendy\u2019s cheeseburgers. But he adds that he doesn\u2019t consider himself a Republican. First Baptist, he says, has \u201cplenty of people who love President Trump and people who don\u2019t love President Trump.\u201d\n\nTo watch him find new ways to justify his support is as impressive as it is exasperating.\n\nSomeone wants to know when Jeffress finds time to read the Bible. Someone has a specific question about a verse in the book of Isaiah. Then a woman with an Australian accent asks Jeffress if Trump is saved. The room gets quiet.\n\nJeffress explains that early on in his relationship with Trump, he asked, \u201cMr. Trump, what do I say when people ask me about your faith?\u201d He says Trump responded, \u201cTell people that my faith is very important to me but that it\u2019s also very personal.\u201d\n\nThen someone asks if he agrees with the president about the news media. Jeffress looks right at me and smiles. He tells the audience that his mother was a high school journalism teacher. Her former students went on to work for some of the best newspapers in the country. \u201cI honestly believe that most of the media tries their hardest to get it right,\u201d he says, adding that the freedom of religion and freedom of the press are inextricably linked by the First Amendment.\n\nOver the following weeks, Jeffress and I discuss Russia and the forthcoming Mueller report, the joys of raising children (he has two daughters), the #MeToo movement and the church\u2019s relationship with women. Every time we talk\u2014no matter the headlines, no matter the president\u2019s latest inflammatory remarks\u2014Jeffress is steadfast in his defense of Trump. When the Mueller report is released in April and shows ample evidence of obstruction of justice, Jeffress says he still believes the entire investigation has been a political ploy to damage the president.\n\nTo watch him find new ways to justify his support is as impressive as it is exasperating. I ask him if he\u2019s bothered when the president tells easily disprovable lies\u2014like when he claims, contrary to the evidence, that special prosecutor Robert Mueller is a Democrat.\n\n\u201cI operate under the assumption that the president knows more than we do,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he probably has insight into that investigation that I don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nNot once, in all the months we\u2019ve met, has Jeffress criticized Trump. I want to know if he is at all concerned by the cost of this allegiance. I ask if he worries about turning off seekers with what they might perceive as his hypocrisy. Even Billy Graham ultimately regretted his involvement with Richard Nixon.\n\nHe tells me he isn\u2019t concerned. He endorses the president\u2019s policies and not necessarily his behavior, he says, and most people are smart enough to know the difference. I ask if he worries that Trump is driving deeper the wedges in our society or stoking dangerous ideologies and emboldening nefarious actors. He tells me he believes the president has merely exposed the division in our country and that a public figure isn\u2019t responsible when someone misinterprets a message as a call for violence. \u201cThere have been screwballs and zealots throughout history who have taken the truth and twisted it,\u201d he says.\n\nI ask if he at least holds Trump accountable. Does he ever criticize the president in their private meetings? \u201cIf it had happened, I wouldn\u2019t tell you about it,\u201d he replies, \u201cbecause I just feel like friends don\u2019t do that to one another.\u201d\n\nI ask him whether Trump might be a test from God, a test of whether Jeffress\u2019s devotion is to the Bible\u2019s teachings and requirements or whether it\u2019s to a powerful leader whose policies he finds agreeable.\n\n\u201cYou have to operate on the best information that you have, and what we had in 2016 was the choice between two diametrically opposed candidates,\u201d he says. \u201cOne was pro-life, pro\u2013religious liberty, pro\u2013conservative judiciary. His name was Donald Trump. One was a pro-choice candidate who would not stop an abortion or limit an abortion for any reason at all. It could not have been a more clear choice at that point.\u201d\n\nDid he consider any of the sixteen other Republican candidates, most of whom would have appointed pro-life judges?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of them could have won,\u201d Jeffress says.\n\nJeffress is often asked what it would take for evangelicals to walk away from the president. If the economy collapses, he tells me, people will probably want a change. And if the president were caught being unfaithful to his wife while in office, he could see people having a problem with that. But more than anything, it would take a change in policies.\n\n\u201cIf he said, \u2018You know, I think we\u2019ve got enough conservatives on the Supreme Court. It\u2019s time for us to have some more moderate views and balance things out.\u2019 Or if he suddenly decided, \u2018You know what, I used to be pro-choice, and then I turned pro-life. I\u2019m gonna go back to pro-choice again.\u2019 I mean, those would certainly be deal-breakers, I think.\u201d\n\nThen he clarifies. He knows his audience. What he meant was that these changes would be deal-breakers for evangelicals politically, not for his own relationship with Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his friend,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll never walk away.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in the August 2019 issue of Texas Monthly with the headline \u201cThe Pastor and the President.\u201d Subscribe today.", "url": "https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/donald-trump-defender-dallas-pastor-robert-jeffress/"}, "article2": {"title": "Robert Jeffress on Trump and 'A Place Called Heaven'", "content": "Pastor Robert Jeffress talks about his support for Donald Trump\u2014and why Christians have an obligation to be involved in politics.\n\nLast Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted out an endorsement of a \u201cgreat book\u201d by \u201ca wonderful man\u201d: A Place Called Heaven, a new work on the afterlife by Pastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist church in Dallas. Jeffress is a member of Trump\u2019s informal council of evangelical advisors and has backed many of the president\u2019s controversial decisions, including war of words with North Korea. \u201cGod has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un,\u201d Jeffress said in August.\n\nThen, last Saturday, Jeffress announced on Twitter that he would host the Fox News anchor Sean Hannity at his church on Sunday. Critics ranging from the political commentator Erick Erickson to Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska replied caustically. According to Erickson, the pastor \u201cseems more committed to Trump\u2019s America than Jesus\u2019s eternity.\u201d In an interview, Jeffress responded critically, wondering if Sasse and others would criticize religious leaders who were involved in the American revolution, the abolition of slavery, and the civil-rights movement.\n\nJeffress, who sees himself as Trump\u2019s \u201cmost vocal and visible evangelical spokesman,\u201d embodies a distinct school of thought about the way Christians should relate to politics. During his sermon the day Hannity came, Jeffress spoke about Supreme Court decisions that he felt had derailed the country. He encouraged his parishioners to be politically engaged: \u201cHow do we push back against evil in the world?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne way we do it in our country, a major way we do it, is through the government officials that we elect.\u201d\n\nJeffress peppered in little digs at the left, referring to the \u201cpinhead lawyers from the ACLU and the Freedom from Religion Foundation\u201d and later introducing Hannity as \u201cRachel Maddow\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d But he was most focused on what he saw as widespread cultural decay. \u201cWe have allowed the atheists, the infidels, the humanists to seize control of this country and pervert our Constitution into something the Founders never intended,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to say enough to that.\u201d\n\nNone of this is incidental to Jeffress\u2019s project of teaching people about \u201ca place called heaven\u201d: He believes God calls on Christians to engage in and shape politics. To some, like Hannity, this influence is crucial: \u201cThere are too few pastors \u2026 that are willing to step out [and] take a strong political position,\u201d he said at First Baptist last week. \u201cIf we don\u2019t save the culture, we\u2019re going to lose our country.\u201d But not all Christians agree.\n\nI spoke with Jeffress about his book, his views on the president, and how he thinks about evangelicals who might feel alienated Jeffress\u2019s approach to politics. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: You write about the importance of judicial righteousness\u2014being right with God\u2014and ethical righteousness\u2014being right as you act in the world.\n\nHow do you make sure you\u2019re acting with ethical righteousness as you present yourself in the world?\n\nRobert Jeffress: That\u2019s the struggle every follower of Jesus Christ has. It\u2019s a daily struggle to always make sure I\u2019m aligning my conduct with what the word of God teaches. All of us are sinners who can only be saved by God\u2019s grace. But I don\u2019t think Christians who have received judicial righteousness have a license to do whatever they want as they await their departure to heaven. Every true believer has a responsibility to live out his faith in his daily life.\n\n\u201cOne way we push back against evil is through the leaders we elect.\u201d\n\nGreen: You said during a recent sermon that it\u2019s important for Christians to be politically active. How is this related to that call to ethical righteousness\u2014and to follow Jesus and the path to heaven?\n\nJeffress: There\u2019s a dichotomy in Scripture that Jesus expressed in John 17. He said to his heavenly father, \u201cThey are not to be of the world \u2026 but I\u2019m not asking you to take them out of the world.\u201d We, as Christians, are really citizens of two worlds: Our ultimate citizenship is in heaven, but God has left us here on earth for a reason.\n\nIn Matthew 5:3-16, he describes our function in the world as salt and light. In Jesus\u2019s day, salt was a preservative that was used to delay the decay of meat. Jesus has left us here to be a preservative in society, to push back against evil, to slow the decay of our world, so that we have longer to share the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nI don\u2019t think that isolating ourselves from the world is what God has called us to do. In our country, one way we push back against evil is through the leaders we elect and the policies they enact.\n\nGreen: It seems like that can be complicated in practice. We saw this over the weekend when Senator Ben Sasse and others criticized your decision to host the Fox News anchor Sean Hannity on a Sunday morning at your church. Here\u2019s what Senator Sasse said:\n\nBy the way, we're talking about Sunday here... (You can be free from politics.) https://t.co/4u50JftVrS \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) October 22, 2017\n\nWhat do you think about his perspective?\n\nJeffress: Well, I have several reactions to that. First of all, what business is it of a United States senator as to what any local church chooses to do in its service? It is chilling to think that a senator would involve himself and criticize a church of which he is not a part.\n\nThe second thing is that he tweeted this out on a Saturday night before we\u2019d even had our service. The fact is, if you\u2019ll listen, Sean Hannity didn\u2019t say anything about politics. I interviewed him about his faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd the third problem is the presumption that Christians should not be involved in the political process. I wonder if Senator Sasse would criticize the pastors who led the way in the American revolution; the pastors who led the way in the abolition of slavery; or pastors like Martin Luther King Jr. who led the civil-rights movement. Would Senator Sasse tell them they\u2019re being too political and that has no business in the church? I doubt it.\n\n\u201cI never preach partisan politics in our service.\u201d\n\nGreen: During your conversation at First Baptist Church with Sean Hannity last Sunday, you emphasized \u201chow grateful I am for a courageous man like Sean Hannity, who is out in the public square pushing back against evil, taking every kind of attack you can imagine from people.\u201d\n\nWhy did you invite a political pundit to speak in your church, and how does that connect with your teachings about getting into heaven?\n\nJeffress: This is something we do two or three times a year. We usually will invite a well-known Christian to come for an interview segment\u2014somebody that our people will be familiar with. And I talk to them about their faith.\n\nSeveral weeks ago we had Ainsley Earhardt from Fox and Friends, who is a strong Christian. The day Ainsley spoke, and after my interview with Sean, when I gave the invitation for people to become Christians, dozens and dozens of people came forward professing their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWe use this as a hook to encourage our people to invite guests to our church\u2014guests who aren\u2019t Christians, or guests who may be looking for a church home. I preach the sermon, and I\u2019m always careful to present the plan of salvation and give opportunities to people to trust in Christ as their savior.\n\nGreen: You remarked during your interview with Sean Hannity that you have Democrats in your congregation, who are just as welcome there as Republicans.\n\nJeffress: Absolutely.\n\nGreen: Do you ever worry, though, that preaching about politics may be alienating to those who don\u2019t identify as political conservatives? For example, on Sunday, you preached about Supreme Court cases on school prayer, abortion, and gay marriage that went terribly wrong.\n\nJeffress: I never preach partisan politics in our service. Any issue that I talk about, like I did Sunday, are biblical issues. The issue of abortion, the issue of the mention of God in the public square, the issue of the sanctity of the family: Those are biblical issues. Yes, they intersect with politics, because governmental policies either support a biblical stance or they denigrate a biblical stance. But these are not Republican or Democrat issues. These are biblical issues.\n\n\u201cLook, we don\u2019t elect presidents on the basis of whether or not they\u2019re role models.\u201d\n\nGreen: Are you worried about young evangelical Christians who may disagree with what President Trump stands for and feel alienated from the church because of evangelical leaders\u2019 wholehearted support for him?\n\nJeffress: Well, I don\u2019t worry about it, because it hasn\u2019t affected our church at all. We opened this new campus four years ago\u2014a $135 million new campus in downtown Dallas\u2014and we thought the space would last us for a long time. But we\u2019re already out of space, and the fastest-growing area of our church is our young-adult area. Our family center is out of room with children and pre-schoolers.\n\nI don\u2019t talk about President Trump, and I certainly didn\u2019t talk about candidate Trump, from our pulpit. During the whole campaign, I may have mentioned President Trump one or two times in passing. People who think I stand up and talk about Donald Trump every Sunday certainly don\u2019t listen to my messages.\n\nGreen: Do you believe that President Trump is a good role model for Christians?\n\nJeffress: I think he\u2019s a great role model for doing what he\u2019s been called to do, and that is being president of the United States. He is doing a fantastic job in that way. I think he is showing strong leadership.\n\nLook, we don\u2019t elect presidents on the basis of whether or not they\u2019re role models. I\u2019ve said before, to the president, I might not select him to be a children\u2019s Sunday School teacher. But that\u2019s not what we were electing President Trump to do. We were electing him to be commander in chief and the leader of our country. I think he\u2019s doing a fantastic job at that.\n\n[Jeffress followed up in an email to say: \u201cI do think President Trump is a positive role model for children. Specifically, I would be happy for my children (and now, my coming grandchildren) to emulate his work ethic, leadership skills, and patriotism.\u201d]\n\nGreen: As you know, a reporter asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a recent White House press briefing about why President Trump would support you, given your allegedly anti-Catholic views. Do you have a response to that, and do you believe, as you\u2019ve said, that the contemporary Catholic Church reflects \u201cthe genius of Satan\u201d in its teaching of Christianity?\n\nJeffress: I\u2019ve been very clear: I believe that nobody goes to heaven in a group. We go one by one based on our relationship to Jesus Christ. I believe there will be millions of Catholics in heaven who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nI love my fellow Catholics who are brothers and sisters in Christ. I work alongside them in religious-liberty issues. I walk alongside them in pro-life rallies. I count them as great friends. In today\u2019s world, not all Baptists believe all of Baptist theology, and I don\u2019t think all Catholics believe all of Catholic theology. Faith is a very personal thing, and I just know there are going to be millions of Catholics in heaven because they\u2019ve trusted Christ as their savior. I consider them friends.\n\nGreen: Why do you think reporters and critics perceive that you have some sort of hateful bias?\n\nJeffress: It was no surprise that this attack came immediately after I appeared on Lou Dobbs Friday night, defending the president against criticism by Congresswoman Wilson. An hour or two later, the president tweeted out a nice word about me and my book, A Place Called Heaven. Immediately, many in the left-wing media\u2014and it was the left-wing, liberal media\u2014attacked me as being anti-Catholic by pulling out quotes from years ago that were either manufactured or taken out of context.\n\nI think it was very clearly an attempt to discredit the president by discrediting his most vocal and visible evangelical spokesman.\n\nGreen: Do you think the president has read your book about going to heaven?\n\nJeffress: Well, I gave it to him about a month ago in the Oval Office. You\u2019d need to ask him about that.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/robert-jeffress-trump/544196/"}, "article3": {"title": "Why evangelicals will stand by Trump in 2020", "content": "When my airplane dipped beneath the clouds, I could finally see the earth: interminable horizon, crisscrossing bands of interstate, the cities of the plains, home to more than 7 million souls. Landing in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex feels like drifting down to reality; if everything is bigger in Texas, it\u2019s also more intense \u2014 the light brighter, the shadows deeper. I was particularly grateful for all that harsh relief in April, because I had come to take stock of a spiritual situation tailor-made to emphasize every challenge in the contest of conscience between heaven and earth. How are evangelical Christians faring in the age of Trump, and will they elect him anew in 2020?\n\nEvangelicals \u2014 typically activist, biblically focused Protestants with an emphasis on conversion, or being born again in Christ, as it\u2019s often put \u2014 span several denominations, all races and plenty of American territory. In 2014, the Pew Research Center found that 31 percent of Texans consider themselves evangelical, forming the largest bloc of religious voters in the state of more than 28 million. A full 65 percent of those voters are white, 22 percent are Latino, and 8 percent are black.\n\nExit polls show that Trump carried 85 percent of evangelical voters here in 2016, a touch higher than the national white evangelical average of 81 percent. That in itself wasn\u2019t surprising: For decades, evangelicals have been a reliable Republican constituency.\n\nMore intriguing was that a segment of white evangelicals had supported Trump all along \u2014 even during the Republican primaries, when more logical evangelical candidates, such as Texas\u2019s own Sen. Ted Cruz, were still viable. At first, their numbers were relatively small and ill-represented among regular churchgoers. But since coalescing in 2016, evangelical support for Trump has remained consistently high \u2014 even among regular churchgoers, who started out skeptical but now approve of Trump at rates identical to or higher than less-regular attendees.\n\nWhite evangelicals\u2019 electoral drift toward Trump added an element of mystery to a story that was already startling. That the thrice-wed, dirty-talking, sex-scandal-plagued businessman actually managed to win the steadfast moral support of America\u2019s values voters, as expressed in routinely high approval ratings, posed an even stranger question: What happened?\n\nTheories about Trump\u2019s connection with evangelical voters have long been dubiously elegant. The simplest, and perhaps most comfortable for Trump\u2019s bewildered and furious opposition, is that evangelicals are and always were hypocrites, demanding moral rectitude from their enemies that they don\u2019t expect from their friends. Others held that evangelicals must simply be ignorant, taken in by a campaign narrative that attempted to depict Trump as privately devoted to Christ, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Some argued that evangelicals just wanted an invincible champion to fight the culture wars, even if he didn\u2019t share their vision of the good life. And then there was the transactional theory: Their votes were just about the Supreme Court.\n\nThere was probably some truth to every suggestion, with all the usual caveats about different individuals having different priorities, and all due distinctions made between the committedly vs. casually religious. But as 2020 approaches and evangelicals again find themselves evaluating against traditional, moderate Democrats such as Joe Biden and the ever-present possibility of just staying home, I wanted to ask evangelicals how they\u2019re feeling about their alliance with the president and what their expectations are going into 2020.\n\nThe inquiry was equal parts spiritual and political, and maybe more so for me than the people I wanted to query. About half of my extended family is evangelical, and the thought of an impenetrable gulf of understanding between myself (a left-leaning Catholic and a member of the media to boot) and the people who had always seemed most familiar disturbed me. Had things really changed so much so quickly \u2014 and how? \u2014 or had I simply missed something long approaching? Of course, I should have known from enough time with this faith that probing mysteries leads only to stranger, harder questions.\n\nMaundy Thursday\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress, second from left, prays with congregants at First Baptist Dallas after a service on June 30. ( Ilana Panich-Linsman/for The Washington Post)\n\nI met Robert Jeffress on what is traditionally a Christian day of service that in some denominations includes the washing of feet, the Thursday preceding Good Friday in the great spiritual windup to Easter Sunday. Downtown Dallas\u2019s glittering First Baptist church campus, where Jeffress regularly preaches to audiences of 4,000 or so (not to mention some 16,000 tuning in remotely), was alive with activity in preparation for the upcoming holy days. I was ushered into a first-floor meeting room with polished wood furniture and stained-glass windows that, despite being entirely interior, glowed from within. Jeffress soon joined me. The pastor wore a crisp suit and rich purple tie, common enough around Easter time, because the soldiers who mocked Christ before his Crucifixion draped him in kingly violet.\n\nJeffress, 63, has called himself Trump\u2019s \u201cmost vocal and visible evangelical supporter,\u201d which is no mean feat, considering that other local megachurch pastors \u2014 Prestonwood Baptist Church\u2019s Jack Graham and Gateway Church\u2019s Robert Morris \u2014 also joined the president\u2019s evangelical advisory board, a group of spiritual counselors formed during the 2016 campaign.\n\nJeffress was an early and ardent Trump adopter \u2014 \u201cI was one of the earliest,\u201d he told me, recalling a conversation he\u2019d had with Trump in January 2016. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Trump, I believe you\u2019re going to be the next president of the United States, and if that happens, it\u2019s because God has a great plan for you and for our country.\u2019 \u201d Trump pressed him, Jeffress said, to which the pastor replied: \u201cDaniel 2 says God is the one who installs kings and establishes kings and removes kings.\u201d For his faith and his loyalty (including an episode in which Jeffress\u2019s gospel choir serenaded a Trump rally with an ode to his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan), Trump has richly rewarded Jeffress, tweeting positively about the pastor\u2019s books and inviting him to numerous events, including an Inauguration Day prayer ceremony, a Christmas reception and a White House dinner honoring an executive-order signing.\n\nJeffress has a clear sense of how Trump fits into evangelicals\u2019 political history. In particular, he felt that Trump couldn\u2019t have come at any other time: that his success among evangelicals had, in large part, to do with the well-documented failure of evangelical politics to bring about change in the past 50 years.\n\nThe first president he ever voted for, Jeffress said, was Jimmy Carter, in 1976. \u201cHe was a Christian,\u201d Jeffress pointed out. \u201cPeople were excited about his candidacy.\u201d But, though Carter was a virtuous, Bible-quoting, born-again Baptist, the pastor found himself disappointed with Carter\u2019s presidency. His next vote, he said, was for Ronald Reagan: \u201cthe first divorced president in history.\u201d\n\nJeffress suggested that it was the Democrats, with their support of Bill Clinton, who introduced the separation of character and policy in electing leaders. But the dawn of the split seems, in reality, to have come before that \u2014 even for Jeffress. Reagan pre-dated Clinton, and Jeffress was, by his own account, already willing to cast his vote for a conservative divorced man at that point. And in 2011, Jeffress advised voters to shun Mormon Mitt Romney in favor of Jeffress\u2019s preferred candidate, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in part due to Perry\u2019s evangelical virtues. \u201cDo we want a candidate who is a good, moral person,\u201d Jeffress told attendees at the Values Voter Summit, referring to Romney, \u201cor one who is a born-again follower of the Lord Jesus Christ?\u201d The objective value of a candidate\u2019s personal Christian commitments in evangelical calculus appears, over time, hard to predict.\n\nBut one consistent trend in the relationship between evangelicals and their candidates did stand out in Jeffress\u2019s telling: increasing disillusionment.\n\nPresident Trump and pastor Robert Jeffress participate in a Celebrate Freedom event at the Kennedy Center in July 2017 in Washington. (Pool/Getty Images)\n\nReagan talked about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Jeffress said, as did George W. Bush \u2014 but both of them failed to act on it. And the Bush era, in Jeffress\u2019s telling, was even more disappointing than the Reagan era. Not only were the gains for evangelicals disappointingly small, but also the losses seemed huge.\n\n\u201cI remember very well back in 2004,\u201d Jeffress recounted, \u201cbeing on a conference call with religious leaders and how disappointed they were with George W. Bush, and how they felt like he had just really misled us. . . . I don\u2019t want to disparage him at all,\u201d Jeffress added, \u201cbut what came out of that eight years? A $7 trillion war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nTrump found an evangelical base still prepared to vote Republican, though soured by the failures of past leaders who had made much of their own personal virtue without accomplishing anything for their voters. Cynicism had set in, at least in Jeffress\u2019s account, and Trump was especially well situated to speak to jaded disappointment.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign was premised on the idea that only he could reveal and replace the secret weakness at the heart of everything \u2014 that because of his own personal riches, he could ostensibly fund his own campaign, freeing him from obedience to the wealthy interests that otherwise capture politicians. He knew this, he said, because he had been on the other side of things, spending money on his various primary opponents at times to purchase their services. \u201cI give to everybody,\u201d he declared in 2015, during the first Republican primary debate. \u201cWhen they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me.\u201d For a frustrated conservative wondering why Republican presidents had never seemed to make good on their promises to evangelicals while their cultural cachet continued to slip, Trump\u2019s blatant indictment of corrupt, money-driven politics must have seemed refreshingly honest \u2014 even if part of his admission was that he himself participated in it.\n\nIt was one of many ways in which Trump\u2019s less-than-Christian behavior seemed, paradoxically, to make him a more appealing candidate to beleaguered, aggravated Christians. \u201cI think conservatives for decades have felt bullied by the left, and the default response was to roll over and take it,\u201d Jeffress said. But Trump enacted a practice of hitting back twice as hard whenever a critic takes him on \u2014 not exactly turning the other cheek, I pointed out. Jeffress chuckled. Trump\u2019s \u201cfavorite verse in the Bible he says is \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth,\u2019 \u201d the very maxim Christ was rebutting when he taught believers to return offense with peace.\n\nCould it take a decidedly worldly man to reverse the fortunes of evangelicals who feel that their earthly prospects have significantly dimmed?\n\nCould it take a decidedly worldly man to reverse the fortunes of evangelicals who feel, for whatever host of reasons \u2014 social, racial, spiritual, political \u2014 that their earthly prospects have significantly dimmed?\n\nJeffress didn\u2019t think so, but not for the reasons I would have guessed. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe that regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C., that the general trajectory of evangelicalism is going to be downward until Christ returns,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you read the scripture, it\u2019s not: Things get better and better and more evangelical-friendly or Christian-friendly; it is, they get worse and more hostile as the culture does. . . . I think most Christians I know see the election of Donald Trump as maybe a respite, a pause in that. Perhaps to give Christians the ability and freedom more to share the gospel of Christ with people before the ultimate end occurs and the Lord returns.\u201d\n\nIt was strange to think of Trump as a bulwark against precipitous moral decline. After all, he appears to have presided over a more rapid coarsening of news and discourse than the average candidate. Even if you count modern history as a story of dissolution and degeneracy, few, if any, other world leaders have launched as many headlines containing censored versions of the word \u201cpussy.\u201d\n\nBut Jeffress didn\u2019t see Trump pausing the disintegration of evangelical fortunes by way of personal virtue \u2014 or even cultural transformation. He spoke instead of \u201caccommodation,\u201d perhaps alluding to the kind of protections announced only a few weeks after our talk by Trump\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, which safeguards the jobs of health-care workers who object to participating in certain procedures for religious reasons. Rather than renewing a culture in peril, in other words, Jeffress seemed to view Trump as someone who might carve out a temporary, provisional space for evangelicals to manage their affairs.\n\nThat sounded familiar to Lydia Bean, 38, a researcher who taught at Baylor University and devoted her graduate sociology work at Harvard to studying the comparative politics of evangelicals in the United States and Canada. These days, Bean is a fellow with New America\u2019s Political Reform program, where she writes and consults on political organizing and faith. When we spoke, she was gearing up to run as a Democrat for a seat in the Texas state House.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s like a fortress mentality, where it\u2019s like \u2014 the best we can do is lock up the gates and just pour boiling oil over the gates at the libs,\u201d Bean said as we ate dinner at a tiny German restaurant near Texas Christian University in Fort Worth that night. Among evangelicals, she said, \u201cI really think one of the things that\u2019s changed since I did my fieldwork at the very end of the Bush administration is a rejection of politics in general as a means to advance the common good, even in a conservative vein.\u201d In that case, politics \u201cbecomes a bloodsport, where you\u2019re punishing and striking back at people you don\u2019t like\u201d without much hope of changing anything. For that kind of \u201chopeless cynicism\u201d regarding politics \u2014 walls up, temporary provisions, with just enough strength and zeal left to periodically foil one\u2019s enemies \u2014 Trump is an ideal leader.\n\nAs to the cultural facts on the ground, Jeffress might have something of a point: Overall, American culture is hardly trending toward adherence to evangelical beliefs, with approval of same-sex marriage steadily rising among all religious groups (even evangelicals), religious affiliation quickly dropping and support for legal abortion lingering at all-time highs. Jeffress is hardly alone in believing that evangelicals need some sort of special accommodations from a society that doesn\u2019t share their values and that they feel persecuted by; according to a Pew Research Center survey released this year, roughly 50 percent of Americans believe evangelicals face some or a lot of discrimination, including about a third of Democrat-leaning respondents. If the rhetoric of spiritual renewal that at times illuminated the Bush presidency has ultimately faded, it makes sense that a figure such as Trump should inherit its dimming twilight and all the anger, despair and darkness that dashed dreams entail.\n\nStill, the portrait of a bitter, brief victory amidst creeping defeat felt somehow ill-fitting as I thought over the day\u2019s conversations on that spring evening so near to Easter. Was it really all so perilously close to the end? Jeffress had his man in the Oval Office, after all, and his justices on the Supreme Court. And all along the highways linking Dallas and Fort Worth, megachurches were advertising their upcoming services; Jeffress\u2019s communications assistant had even invited me to a Palm Sunday procession through the streets of downtown Dallas that she estimated would attract thousands. And thousands did come.\n\nGood Friday\n\nFrom left, Bob Collins, Claude Ann Collins and Bart Barber at First Baptist Church in Farmersville, Tex., on June 29. (Laura Buckman for The Washington Post)\n\nThe next day, my husband and I drove more than an hour northeast of Dallas to Farmersville, a town of fewer than 4,000 that lies on plains across a shallow lake studded with the bare branches of half-submerged trees. We arrived at the First Baptist Church of Farmersville shortly before the evening service, accompanied by a steady stream of worshipers and a warm wind. A plaque on the red-brick building\u2019s exterior states that its roots stretch back to a meeting of 15 men beneath the shelter of a brush arbor in 1865; inside, its sanctuary is stately and well preserved, with a high vaulted ceiling and glittering stained-glass windows. We were immediately met by a greeter who assured us we were more than welcome, and despite the now well-known tensions between the media and red America, I knew he was being sincere.\n\nAs we settled into a maroon-upholstered pew, a middle-aged man with bright eyes and a crisp suit approached to welcome us, too. His name was Wesley Sisk, and when he learned we had come to talk about Trump, he was elated. \u201cWe think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d he enthused, \u201cdespite what some people think,\u201d with a mischievous grin.\n\nSisk was one of the narrators that evening, reading from the Gospel of John. After opening prayers and a pair of hymns, Sisk took the lectern before the hushed congregation \u2014 elderly and young, some in suits and some in boots, with several babies and a few cowboy hats in laps \u2014 and began to relay the story of the night of Christ\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe narrative unfolded between hymns and Communion: Jesus, betrayed by Judas and denied by Peter, faces a range of accusers who finally turn Him over to the Roman provincial governor Pontius Pilate, who seems more frustrated with the disturbance than committed to justice. Pilate interrogates Christ: Is He really, as his accusers say He has claimed, the king of the Jews?\n\nJesus famously replies that his kingdom is not of this world, an answer that has proved fertile ground, over the centuries, for Christian disagreement over the proper theological management of earthly affairs. Is there a Christian politics, or only a brief and remote sojourn on Earth, during which Christians ought to seek their own peace but leave political rule to earthly kings? Or is there a way to join the two paths?\n\nAfter the service, I joined First Baptist\u2019s pastor \u2014 a tall, gentle-spoken, bespectacled man named Bart Barber \u2014 along with several members of his flock for a dinner conversation that seemed to revolve around those long-standing points of contention, and their immediate incarnation in the figure of Trump.\n\nBarber invited us to the home of Bob and Claude Ann Collins, two congregants active in local and national GOP politics, whose farmhouse sits on more than 100 acres of prairie dotted at this time of year with bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush and soft, high grass. Along with Barber and his wife, Tracy, and the Collinses, we met David Coleman, a retired insurance agent who now raises cattle with his 93-year-old father; Dale and Maria Ivy, a chef and recently naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Mexico, respectively; a local journalist who wanted to observe the evening, and several of the gathered couples\u2019 adolescent children.\n\nFor Barber, at least, warming up to Trump had taken some time. He wasn\u2019t alone in that: An October 2016 poll by LifeWay Research, a Christian polling group, found that only 39 percent of evangelical pastors planned to vote for Trump. Barber himself voted for independent Evan McMullin, \u201cand my congregation knew about that,\u201d he added, \u201calthough almost no one agreed with me.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s character nagged at Barber. Citing John F. Kennedy, he pointed out that almost anyone running seems to have skeletons in his closet. \u201cBut the things that really bothered me,\u201d he said, \u201cwere ways that [Trump] would react to things in ways that seemed intemperate and harsh.\u201d Barber remembered with particular distaste an incident during the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, when Trump tweeted that two critically ill American missionary health-care workers shouldn\u2019t be treated in the United States \u2014 but should instead \u201csuffer the consequences\u201d of their decision to provide charitable aid. Trump \u201chad an inclination to stoke the fears of people,\u201d Barber said, whether it related to illness, religious entry bans or immigration. And he seemed like a \u201cJohnny-come-lately\u201d to many evangelical issues.\n\nThe Collinses and Dale Ivy went into 2016 rooting for Cruz; Ivy said Trump was initially his last choice. Barber had hoped for either former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee or Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). But as the primaries heated up and dropouts began, each of them began to review his or her choice. At a six-week Bible class, the group and other congregants explored the question of whether one votes for a candidate\u2019s politics or character, Dale Ivy remembered, and they decided that \u201cpolicy is character\u201d \u2014 a conclusion a few of them recited somberly in unison, like received wisdom. Dale Ivy came to align with Trump, he recalled, \u201cbecause we needed change,\u201d while Coleman ultimately decided that, \u201cas flawed as Trump\u2019s character is, it was a lot better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s.\u201d\n\nEven as Trump took office, doubts lingered. Maria Ivy, who was naturalized several years ago, expressed some misgivings about Trump\u2019s tendency to generalize about all illegal immigrants. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed,\u201d Maria said of her experience. \u201cI was a professional. But if you do not have an education, you can\u2019t just go apply for immigration. A lot of the people who come here illegally, they are poor and just trying to come to survive, and help their families.\u201d Maria and Dale Ivy both agreed that vetting is an important part of the immigration process, while Bob Collins voiced concern that someone or something malign is behind the surge of migrants at the southern border. For them, Trump\u2019s quest to build the wall and halt immigration from Latin America has come as a welcome check on these nefarious forces. Barber, meanwhile, still has his concerns: He knows illegal immigrants in town, he offered, \u201cand none of them are rapists.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, others warmed up to Trump quickly. Trump, Bob Collins said, \u201chas done something no other politician has done: He\u2019s circumvented the press. The press has a problem now. \u2026 I wish he would not do the personal attacks, but he needs to get the message out, even if it\u2019s a blunt, brute-force message.\u201d For them, the message was a welcome one. \u201cWe\u2019re deplorables,\u201d the Collinses intoned in unison, when I asked them what messages they had heard from Democrats. \u201cWe cling to our religion and our guns,\u201d Coleman said, mocking the famous Barack Obama remark from 2008. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much room in the Democratic Party for evangelicals like me,\u201d Barber added. \u201cEven though Donald Trump is different than me, the Donald Trump White House tries to move toward evangelicals like me.\u201d\n\nBarber now considers himself willing to vote for Trump, despite his concerns about the president\u2019s temperament. First, there\u2019s the abortion issue. \u201cTrump might say some things that run against the basic ethos of evangelical Christianity,\u201d Barber acknowledged, but he has also put in place two Supreme Court justices who are known to take antiabortion positions. It was abortion, too, that delivered Coleman \u2014 who considers himself an independent \u2014 to Trump in the first place: \u201c[Clinton] would not say she was against partial-birth abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand \u2014 but don\u2019t agree with it at all \u2014 but I can understand their thinking in the early trimesters. But killing a child . . .\u201d This issue has, among evangelicals, become more important since 2016: Renewed attention to the question of late-term abortion stirred by the passage of a state law in New York and an attempt in Virginia has brought fresh fervor to the group, shoring up support for Trump in the coming election.\n\nBarber also noted that the things he strongly disagrees with Trump on \u2014 immigration and threats to infringe upon the religious liberty of Muslims via travel bans \u2014 have been, in his view, mostly unsuccessful. Thus, he reasoned, many of the excesses he worried about in 2016 now seem unlikely to unfold. So with Trump delivering more than evangelical skeptics had expected and causing less damage than they had feared, Barber now feels more open to casting his vote for the incumbent in 2020.\n\nBut perhaps the most illuminating moment of the evening came when I asked whether any of them would be willing to vote for a more traditional evangelical challenger to Trump, should one hypothetically rise to oppose him in the primaries.\n\nThe president is having to deal with a den of vipers. I\u2019m not sure Pence could do that. Bob Collins\n\nAt first, there were murmurs about the possibility of Vice President Pence. But then Maria Ivy warned that Pence is soft compared with Trump, too decent and mannerly to take on the job. Bob Collins agreed: \u201cThe president is having to deal with a den of vipers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Pence could do that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s spiritual warfare,\u201d Dale Ivy added, emphasizing that Trump is the only man in the field who seems strong enough to confront it. \u201cThe Constitution allows us a space,\u201d Bob Collins said, to live according to their faith, and Trump has provided that for them, in part through his Supreme Court nominations. Claude Ann Collins agreed. \u201cWhat space are we going to have to be able to live in and follow our beliefs,\u201d she wondered, without a president willing to carve out such provisions despite widespread criticism?\n\nIn some sense it seemed that Trump is able, by being less Christian than your average Christian, to protect Christians who fear incursions from a hostile dominant culture. But that paradox also supplies a handy solution to the question of whether Christians should direct their efforts to worldly politics or turn inward, shunning political life for spiritual pursuits. By voting for Trump \u2014 even over more identifiably Christian candidates \u2014 evangelicals seem to have found a way to outsource their fears and instead reserve a strictly spiritual space for themselves inside politics without placing evangelical politicians themselves in power. In that sense, they can be both active political agents and a semi-cloistered religious minority, both of the world and removed from it, advancing their values while retreating to their own societies.\n\n\u201cBeing on the precipice of being in a minority group strongly disliked by certain groups of people has made me reflect on people\u2019s rights of conscience,\u201d Barber mused as the evening wound down. The sentiment appeared to have led him in seemingly contrary directions, both into politics and away from the scope of extant legal regimes. He mentioned a Texas state bill he helped write that would protect nonprofit staff, including clergy, from civil liability for warning other nonprofits of allegations of sexual misconduct against former employees. Barber said he was moved to work on the bill by allegations of widespread sexual abuse involving Southern Baptist church leaders and volunteers published in the Houston Chronicle. When we parted ways in the mellow blue night, Barber was still praying the bill would pass \u2014 which it did, unanimously, in May.\n\nHoly Saturday\n\nWes Helm and Lola Vinson, members of a progressive community organizing group called Faith in Texas, pose for a portrait at the group\u2019s office in Dallas on July 17. (Cooper Neill for The Washington Post)\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere, evangelicals take many forms. In 2000, Texas was 53 percent non-Hispanic white and 32 percent Hispanic; by 2016, it was 43 percent non-Hispanic white and 39 percent Hispanic, with the state\u2019s black population holding steady over time. And while most of the rising Hispanic population is Catholic, a growing number are evangelical Protestants, a trend emerging elsewhere both at home and overseas. Meanwhile, the Pew Research Center identifies some 6 percent of Texans as belonging to historically black Protestant churches, which often share significant theological ground with white evangelical counterparts, despite vast social and cultural differences. Just as Texas is by no means the sole province of white evangelicalism, evangelical Christianity itself is by no means strictly white, or strictly conservative. Faith and politics in Texas swirl inside this multiracial, multifaith sphere.\n\nA little before our trip to Farmersville, I met Lola Vinson and Wes Helm, members of a multiracial, progressive community organizing group called Faith in Texas, whose projects have included local criminal-justice reform, anti-police-brutality efforts, a living-wage campaign and agitation against predatory lending. Working with several faith groups in Texas, including evangelicals, is key to the organization\u2019s mission, and I wondered how Vinson and Helm\u2019s experience might have shifted since Trump\u2019s ascendancy.\n\nFor Vinson and Helm, both progressive Christians, organizing across those lines comes naturally, a pillar of their shared work. But, they said, trying to operate across the breaches widened by Trump\u2019s rise among evangelicals has been daunting. \u201cAll of that has gotten more difficult in the last two years,\u201d Helm said.\n\nVinson pointed out that racial, political and ideological divides among different Christian groups, and even within evangelicalism itself, had always existed. But Trump, she said, has intensified them. \u201cI see [Trump] as a figurehead, a representation of just a much larger . . . insidious movement and ideology. None of this is new,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just now been emboldened and brought to the surface because there\u2019s someone on such a large platform with seemingly all the power uplifting this toxic rhetoric.\u201d\n\nHelm said that, among the evangelicals he works with who support Trump, \u201ctheir sense of being under attack has gone up a lot,\u201d leading to a \u201cfeeling of a binary choice in a lot of those folks \u2014 like, \u2018I have to back Trump, because we\u2019re in the middle of a war for our country.\u2019 \u201d That sort of defensiveness can make organizing difficult. But Helm also seemed concerned about its spiritual costs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of evangelicals making arguments that I cannot imagine them making two or three years ago,\u201d Helm remarked, \u201clike trying to play devil\u2019s advocate on things like the immigration policy, or locking up kids.\u201d Justifying Trump\u2019s policies regardless of whether they fit into a Christian ethical framework is, in Helm\u2019s reckoning, \u201cvery much a devil\u2019s bargain of like \u2014 yes, he\u2019s awful; yes, he does not represent our values; but he\u2019s allowing us to pack the courts with justices who do.\u201d\n\nSo many invocations of the Devil at once left me wondering what Helm and Vinson would make of the prospects of their politics: Did they, too, feel, as Jeffress had, that American Christians are destined for ever-greater cataclysms in public life, until the eventual apocalypse resolves in the return of Christ? It struck me that, in the contest between conservative and liberal values Jeffress envisioned his community on the losing side of, nobody seemed to feel he or she was winning: Even Vinson and Helm felt they were undertaking a difficult and oftentimes uphill battle against forces material and intangible.\n\nFor Helm, much of the agony many evangelicals experience as citizens has roots in private pain: \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about Trump voters, people don\u2019t react with this kind of hatred or fear unless there\u2019s pain at the root somewhere, and if you don\u2019t address that pain, you\u2019re never going to break through the hatred and fear.\u201d But neither Vinson nor Helm seemed to think that some kind of values consensus \u2014 and shared work across the divide \u2014 is altogether impossible. They didn\u2019t envision any easy victories. But they did have hope.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got hope for everybody,\u201d Helm said; \u201cyeah, likewise,\u201d Vinson added. \u201cSo I choose to see the God in everyone and hope that that\u2019s for everyone, even the people who are on the other end of the spectrum from where I sit and believe. . . . I wouldn\u2019t be able to get up every day and do the work that I do if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDaniel Aguilar, left, and his father, Joe Aguilar, in Daniel\u2019s home in Fort Worth on June 23. (Ilana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post)\n\nOn Holy Saturday, the day before Easter, I met Joe and Daniel Aguilar, both evangelical, 65 and 33, respectively, father and son. While age has increasingly defined political divisions nationwide \u2014 most notably inside the Democratic Party \u2014 research has revealed a surprising continuity between older and younger evangelicals. As professor Ryan Burge of Eastern Illinois University has found using survey data, while younger evangelicals show signs of parting from their elders when it comes to prioritizing issues such as immigration, young white evangelicals voted for Trump at roughly the same rate as their parents and grandparents. But a fraction \u2014 less than 20 percent \u2014 didn\u2019t, and Daniel was among them.\n\nTo see Joe and Daniel sitting together side by side, as I did, in a Fort Worth taco restaurant, you might guess they\u2019re related; you might also guess that there\u2019s some tension between them, at least where it comes to politics. Joe, a retired CPA, was warm-skinned and a little slighter than his son, with a white beard and a bright yellow T-shirt sporting a prominent icon of Texas situated on the breast. Daniel, an attorney, had his father\u2019s hazelnut eyes and dark, short-cropped hair with a frontal cowlick. They eyed each other warily as I broached the subject of Trump.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Joe said, over chips, salsa and beer, \u201cwe created Trump. He\u2019s a result of everything that happened before; it could have been someone else with that same kind of ridiculous, outlandish outbursts and thoughts and actions. I mean, we got what we deserved. I mean, I don\u2019t like everything he says, but I\u2019m going to vote for him again.\u201d Joe said his 2016 vote for Trump came down to a comparison between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 he printed out the two party platforms, considered them and came away convinced Trump was the only way to go.\n\nDaniel intervened, skeptical. \u201cLooking back in the primary starting in 2015, I mean \u2014 evangelicals put Trump over the top among, what? 16 other otherwise sane candidates. [He] was riding this wave of evangelical support.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was married several times,\u201d Joe acknowledged, a little grudgingly.\n\n\u201cYeah, and I shouldn\u2019t lead off with that because it\u2019s not even the main reason \u2014 it\u2019s demonizing immigrants\u201d and remarks about keeping out people from \u201cshithole countries,\u201d Daniel said.\n\n\u201cBasically,\u201d Joe argued, \u201cTrump is everyone, without the filters. I\u2019m sure at some time you\u2019ve thought some horrible things, but you had a filter there to keep you from saying it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is that a defense?\u201d Daniel asked.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA fact to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust an explanation of why. I mean, he is a raw personality with all filters removed. . . . I think he pretty much exemplifies this sin that we all carry with us. He just doesn\u2019t know how to repress it.\u201d\n\nDaniel nodded, and pressed: \u201cBut it would seem like a natural question would be, you just sounded like you just described some pretty good reasons not to support the man.\u201d\n\nBack and forth like this, on and on: the Green New Deal, taxes, climate change, abortion, with Joe holding that Trump\u2019s essential toughness set him apart from the other slick, polished Republican alternatives, and Daniel pressing as to whether that belligerent approach to politics really accomplishes evangelical goals. \u201cTrump accepts evangelicals,\u201d Joe said, unlike the Democrats. \u201cI think \u2018accepting\u2019 is probably a friendlier term than \u2018exploits the talking points they want to hear,\u2019 \u201d Daniel parried. There were the usual sparring sessions over media dishonesty and the extremes of Trump\u2019s policies, such as family separation at the border, which Joe admitted he didn\u2019t approve of.\n\nEven as father and son staked out a mostly generational conflict between the evangelicals who readily accepted Trump, and those, such as Daniel, who remain skeptical, they still shared signs of affection: little jokes (\u201cYou know, Daniel, I can change my will at any time . . .\u201d), an arm around the shoulder, a hand resting on the back of a neck.\n\nWhatever the costs have been \u2014 and for many, the price of Trump\u2019s policies has been cruel and devastating \u2014 the Aguilars seemed to exhibit that faint hope that Helm and Vinson live on: that evangelicals attached to Trump and those who oppose him can find some common humanity to hold them together, even in the heat of contention; that there might be better things on the horizon than continual decline; that the promise of pursuing those beautiful things might be the key to sealing the rift between Trump\u2019s Christians and all the rest.\n\nEaster Sunday\n\nI had set out to Texas with the intention of spending Easter Sunday with my own family; my uncle, aunt and cousin are evangelical Christians and have been for as long as I can remember, stretching back to days spent at Sunday school, when my aunt would teach and my cousins would sit together in semicircles to read, play and sing. It was only much later in life, long after I had left Texas and spent time among vastly different political and religious climates, that I realized not everyone knew evangelicals personally, and that their world was in some sense exotic to a vast number of commenters who write about them.\n\nIn the end, I couldn\u2019t summon the objectivity to commit my family\u2019s views to the page. I wonder if anyone can, whether they have intimate connections to evangelicals or similarly charged connections to those who fear evangelical politics will endanger their lives, loves, livelihoods or families. There scarcely seems to be a neutral approach to this curious group of voters, whose essence reaches for the extremes \u2014 incorporating the deeply spiritual and the basely practical, focusing primarily on matters of love, sex and reproduction, envisioning both a legal regime transformed by friendly Supreme Court justices and a world set apart from the dominant culture in which their increasingly unusual way of life can flourish.\n\nHowever he reached them, Trump has undoubtedly made greater inroads with his evangelical adherents. Jeffress predicted an even bigger win for Trump among evangelicals this time around, surpassing his record-setting success last time; all of the Farmersville Christians were prepared to vote for him in 2020, as was Joe Aguilar. Much depends on the many months between now and the general election, but I would no longer underestimate the possibility that evangelicals will turn out in stronger numbers for a second Trump term than they did in 2016, partly to ensure another Supreme Court pick and partly because the backlash against them has cemented so much of what they already suspected about liberals\u2019 attitudes.\n\nHowever he reached them, Trump has undoubtedly made greater inroads with his evangelical adherents. Jeffress predicted an even bigger win for Trump among evangelicals this time around.\n\nWhich raises a series of imponderables: Is there a way to reverse hostilities between the two cultures in a way that might provoke a truce? It is hard to see. Is it even possible to return to a style of evangelical politics that favored \u201cfamily values\u201d candidates and a Billy Graham-like engagement with the world, all with an eye toward revival and persuasion? It is hard to imagine.\n\nOr was a truly evangelical politics \u2014 with an eye toward cultural transformation \u2014 less effective than the defensive evangelical politics of today, which seems focused on achieving protective accommodations against a broader, more liberal national culture? Was the former always destined to collapse into the latter? And will the evangelical politics of the post-Bush era continue to favor the rise of figures such as Trump, who are willing to dispense with any hint of personal Christian virtue while promising to pause the decline of evangelical fortunes \u2014 whatever it takes? And if hostilities can\u2019t be reduced and a detente can\u2019t be reached, are the evangelicals who foretell the apocalypse really wrong?\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018He gets it\u2019: Evangelicals aren\u2019t turned off by Trump\u2019s first term\n\nBen Howe: Evangelicals have abandoned their mission in favor of Trump\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: She reported her rape.
