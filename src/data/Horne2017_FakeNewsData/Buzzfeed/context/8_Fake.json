Jeff Farmer\u2019s read \u201cGlobal Ass-Whuppin\u2019 Initiative.\u201d The penny dropped. Jeff Farmer, a professional wrestler, had been Lightning in the tag team of Thunder & Lightning. Jeff Farmer\u2019s signature hold remains the Scorpion Death Lock.\n\nBill Clinton generally maintains the tradition of former Presidents respecting their successors, but the mixture of motives that pull at him is unique. Having stepped off the electoral merry-go-round for good, an ex-President is theoretically free to say what he really thinks. But what about an ex-President whose spouse is a senator contemplating a run for even higher office? Hillary Clinton\u2019s ambitions stoke Bill Clinton\u2019s instinct to be combative on her behalf; by the same token, he must try not to say things that would force her to do a lot of explaining. \u201cMy sense is that he trims his sails on an awful lot of issues because of what it might do in terms of Hillary\u2019s career,\u201d one insider close to both Clintons said.\n\nAs for Clinton\u2019s attitude to his White House successor, his role as the Democratic Party\u2019s (and his wife\u2019s) biggest gun pushes him in one direction, while his role as a non-partisan, above-the-fray doer of global good deeds pushes him in another. A further complication is that his successor\u2019s father is the predecessor whose bid for re\u00eblection he quashed in 1992. If the antecedents are confusing, the emotions are, too. So friendly has Clinton grown with his old opponent George H. W. Bush\u2014they have raised more than a hundred million dollars together, to help the victims of the Asian tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005\u2014that one member of the Clintons\u2019 circle worries that \u201cthe Bush people worked hard to co-opt him,\u201d keeping Clinton quiet, or at least polite, by keeping him close.\n\nMany of Clinton\u2019s sentences begin \u201cWhen I was President\u201d or \u201cDuring our Administration,\u201d but he does not often begin with, for instance, \u201cIf I were President.\u201d And yet when I asked him once whether he ever wished he were unhindered by the Twenty-second Amendment, he hesitated.\n\n\u201c9/11\u2014I wish that I\u2019d been there,\u201d Clinton said. He had been in Australia that day, to give a speech. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been there beforehand, you know, when the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. finally said we agree that bin Laden did the Cole. We could have gone after Afghanistan. And in the aftermath I\u2019d have liked to have been there.\u201d\n\nClinton remains sensitive to accusations that he was too hesitant or distracted in the pursuit of Osama bin Laden\u2014recently, he attacked an ABC docudrama for suggesting that his Administration, given the chance, had failed to fire on bin Laden\u2014and so I asked him what he would have done in Bush\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cI would have gone into Afghanistan, as quick as I could, just as President Bush did,\u201d he said, \u201cand I would have demanded that Saddam open himself up to inspections, because U.N. records indicated that there were unaccounted-for chemical and biological materials. I personally never saw any intelligence on the Al Qaeda connection or the nuclear issue, except that he had some people in labs fooling around with it.\u201d\n\nOnce he got going, Clinton laid out a critique of the Bush Administration, though his was not remotely as harsh as the one Al Gore has provided in the past two years. Tax cuts for the top one per cent of the income scale were \u201cridiculous.\u201d Working people were getting \u201cstiffed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just makes me mad,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wish I were there\u2014I wish I were there trying to articulate the alternative vision.\u201d\n\nWhen opponents of the Bush Administration express nostalgia for the Clinton era, it sometimes has less to do with policy than with the stark contrast between the two men as public speakers, as intelligences. Even Clinton\u2019s critics who feel that he squandered his promise never speculate, as Bush\u2019s critics often do, that he is stupid. When I asked Clinton if he thought intellect was an essential part of being President, he proceeded carefully.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to be curious, I think it\u2019s important to ask questions, I think it\u2019s important to be secure so that you like being around people that know more about every subject than you do and still in the end you trust your own judgment once you hear them out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think intellect is a good thing, unless it paralyzes your ability to make decisions because you see too much complexity. Presidents need to have what I would call a synthesizing intelligence.\n\n\u201cI keep reading that Bush is incurious, but when he talks to me he asks a lot of questions,\u201d Clinton went on. \u201cSo I can\u2019t give him a bad grade on curiosity. I think both he and his father, because they have peculiar speech patterns, have been underestimated in terms of their intellectual capacity. You know, the way they speak and all, it could be, it could just relate to the way the synapses work in their brains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been worried about his intellect so much as his ideological bent. I think he believed\u2014and perhaps correctly\u2014that his father was defeated in \u201992 because he lost the right. And he made up his mind that he\u2019d never lose it. Kind of like George Wallace did when he was beaten for governor.\n\n\u201cI also think that he was genuinely more conservative on questions like concentrations of wealth and power, weakening of environmental and health regulations\u2014things of that kind\u2014than any President we\u2019ve had in a very, very long time. Even more conservative than Reagan, probably, and way to the right of his father and Nixon and Eisenhower. But the thing that bothers me about having an ideology as opposed to a philosophy is that, if you have an ideology, then the outcome is dictated before the facts are in, before the arguments are heard. And that, I think, can cause problems.\u201d\n\nClinton said that Bush, despite employing the slogan \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d never hid his radical-right agenda. \u201cHe said, \u2018Vote for me, and I\u2019ll give you judges like Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia,\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what he did.\u201d\n\nClinton frequently says that he has \u201ca theory of the case\u201d\u2014an overview of how the Republican Party, starting in the nineteen-seventies, moved increasingly to the right. Like many other political analysts, he believes that the Republicans were able to capitalize on the reaction to the counterculture of the nineteen-sixties and the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision, in 1973. \u201cStarting in the late seventies, they really developed the ability to demonize us, independent of the fact that we were for civil rights and against the Vietnam War,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nHe spoke with a professional\u2019s admiration of Reagan\u2019s calm and his talent as a political performer, but said that the Reagan campaign employed \u201cmad dogs\u201d in 1980. \u201cThey called our crowd everything but a blue goose,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI remember looking at these people in the voting line and thinking, Oh my God, it\u2019s going to be a long night, because they were just glassy-eyed. They were there like somebody had fed them some sort of a controlled substance.\u201d\n\nIn the early nineties, Clinton theorized, \u201cwith the increasing diversity in America, and the increasing urbanization, and the suburbs becoming more communitarian and less isolationist, our base slowly moved up to theirs. So, by the time Al Gore ran, we had equal bases.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey can run somebody convicted of armed robbery and, barring a national catastrophe like 9/11, we couldn\u2019t win by more than fifty-five to forty-five, and neither could they, under the present circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right there in the room, and no one even acknowledges me.\u201d Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nClinton is clearly anticipating a widening attack on Hillary\u2019s agonized Senate vote on Iraq in October, 2002. Her speech before the vote denounced pre\u00ebmptive war and asked for greater attempts at diplomacy and weapons inspections in Iraq, but in the end she remains vulnerable to the ever-increasing number of people furious about the war. And so Clinton, in effect, provides her defense. \u201cIt would really be crazy,\u201d he said, \u201cif the anti-war element of our Party thought that the most important thing to do was to beat up on the Democrats, and gave the Republicans a free ride.\u201d\n\nClinton had told me that the Bush Administration\u2019s plan for post-invasion Iraq \u201cwas the sort of thing two students of international relations could have thrown together in forty-five minutes. They were arrogant. They thought it would be easy and they thought there would be no terrorism, that everyone would be on their side.\u201d In more formal interviews, the rambling answer he gave to my questions about what the United States had to do next in Iraq was, like some of Hillary\u2019s speeches, long on complexity and alternatives, short on direction, and unlikely to satisfy voters demanding a renunciation of the war and a rapid withdrawal of American forces.\n\n\u201cI think first of all you\u2019ve got to remind people that we didn\u2019t get into this mess overnight\u2014and we\u2019re not going to get out of it overnight, that we might decide that it\u2019s a lost cause and we just have to withdraw in an expeditious fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that whether you were for or against the original action, it would be better if it did not end in calamity and chaos, mass killing within Iraq, more terrorist bases there. And I think you have to say that this is a national-security issue\u2014and I say that because I don\u2019t think we should have done it until after the U.N. inspections were over, until we had secured Afghanistan, and we had a consensus in the world community. I never thought Saddam presented any kind of a terrorist threat. But once you break these eggs you\u2019ve got to kind of make an omelette. And we\u2019ve just got to be straight about that. And, if it is obvious that there is nothing positive that can come from our committed involvement there, then we have to say we\u2019d be prepared to say we\u2019ll come home\u2014but we\u2019re not there yet. Seventy per cent of those people did vote. They voted to set up this government. And most of them, if left to their own devices without the people with the guns in the middle, would find some way to make some sort of decent go of it.\u201d\n\nClinton had a long day ahead of him in Addis Ababa. In the morning, in a Soviet-style government building that looked as if it had been airlifted from downtown Novosibirsk, he met with Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian Prime Minister. Then it was on to an AIDS clinic and a speech at the African Union.\n\nIn every city where he had time, Clinton called for a few hours of cultural expeditions or shopping\u2014a break. In Durban, he\u2019d picked up an eight-foot-tall wooden giraffe for Hillary (\u201cShe loves giraffes!\u201d) and at a crafts store in Addis he bought loads of gifts for friends and staff, including a gigantic silver Coptic crucifix. His aide Justin Cooper left the store with his arms so full he looked as if he had looted it. Then, at Clinton\u2019s command, we visited the National Museum, which houses the bones of \u201cLucy,\u201d a hominid who lived more than three million years ago. The museum was dingy and underfunded, but the guides were thrilled to open the place to Clinton, even though it was their day off. As he walked past the exhibits, Clinton listened a little and talked a lot. He talked about the giant pigs, the razorbacks, that roam his home state. And as he walked past some of the display cases he started talking about the wonders of the bonobo apes.", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/18/the-wanderer-bill-clinton-profile-david-remnick"}, "article3": {"title": "Emails in Anthony Weiner Inquiry Jolt Hillary Clinton\u2019s Campaign", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D.
