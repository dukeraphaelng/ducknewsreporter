Trump\u2019s rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist, and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see trickle-down racism,\u201d Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains, where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.\u201d\n\nRomney retreat puts spotlight on Trump\u2019s fundraising problem in critical stretch\n\nTrump, speaking at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Friday night, didn\u2019t address Romney\u2019s criticism directly but did say, \u201cI am the least racist person, the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d a line he frequently says at campaign events.\n\nBy Saturday morning, Trump was directly responding to Romney, tweeting, \u201cMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2016\n\nHe then added, \u201cDon King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!\u201d\n\nDon King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2016\n\nHe kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa, Florida, telling the crowd, \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows what a misogynist is. Don\u2019t forget this guy let us down.\u201d He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh.\n\nRomney considering Johnson\n\nRomney, who actively sought to recruit an independent, third-party challenger to Trump, also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge. But he did show a new openness to one non-Trump candidate, libertarian Gary Johnson, whom he did not rule out voting for.\n\nJohnson\u2019s running mate is another former Massachusetts governor, Bill Weld, who once fundraised for Romney. If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard-bearer, Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall.\n\nHillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers\n\n\u201cIf Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president,\u201d Romney said. \u201cSo I\u2019ll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he\u2019s someone who I could end up voting for. That\u2019s something which I\u2019ll evaluate over the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s comments on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d are some of the highest-profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket, which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines. He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson, given his position on marijuana legalization.\n\n\u201cMarijuana makes people stupid,\u201d Romney quipped.\n\nJohnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look.\n\n\u201cI think Mitt Romney hit it on the head. He said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he\u2019s got to say,\u2019\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d \u201cI think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day.\u201d\n\nRomney once again ruled out running himself, but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger. Several sought-after Republicans, including Ben Sasse and author David French, have taken passes.\n\nOrrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third-party contender,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton.\u201d\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, appearing later on \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d dismissed Romney\u2019s criticism.\n\n\u201cThis again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades,\u201d Pierson said.\n\nAnd Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday, \u201cRespect Mitt and differences but couldn\u2019t disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let\u2019s stop this and unify.\u201d\n\nRespect Mitt and differences but couldn't disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let's stop this and unify. \u2014 Reince Priebus (@Reince) June 11, 2016\n\nIn Richmond, Trump alluded to his critics, though he didn\u2019t mention Romney by name.\n\nClinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board\n\n\u201cThese poor people going, \u2018Never Trump, never Trump\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019ve been doing it for months. They did it with Indiana, they did it with New York \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re going to win New York\u2019 \u2013 and I won in a massive landslide.\u201d\n\n\u2018My choice is different\u2019\n\nRomney again speculated about what might be in Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has repeatedly declined to release, claiming that he\u2019s under audit. Asked what might be in there, Romney referred to a months-ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone, but if he released his taxes, he\u2019d lose support,\u201d Romney said. \u201cSo there\u2019s something in those taxes that\u2019s even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue.\u201d\n\nYet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him. Romney\u2019s mentee and vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, has uneasily backed Trump, but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cAre you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him?\u201d Blitzer asked.\n\n\u201cI wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr. Trump and chosen someone else,\u201d Romney said. \u201cBut my choice is different than that of the other people, and I\u2019m certainly not going to argue with them about their choice.\u201d\n\nSanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign\u2019s future\n\nRomney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support, saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary. For much of the campaign, Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front-runner by the people running against him,\u201d he said, lamenting that they were \u201cfiring at each other.\u201d \u201cJeb Bush had a super PAC of over $100 million. And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others, as opposed to focusing it on the front-runner.\u201d\n\nBut if Romney had ran?\n\n\u201cHad I been in the race,\u201d he said, \u201cI can assure you, I would have taken him on.\u201d", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/10/politics/mitt-romney-donald-trump-racism/index.html"}, "article2": {"title": "Romney rips 2016 also-rans for losing to Trump", "content": "Romney reserved particular scorn for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who Romney endorsed late in the primary process. The Texas senator, he pointed out, spent extensive time during the campaign praising Trump. He also said Ohio Gov. John Kasich had divided the anti-Trump vote by remaining in the race long after it had become clear he didn\u2019t have a realistic pathway to the nomination \u2014 a message he said he had relayed personally to the Ohio governor. And Romney chided Right to Rise, the $100 million-plus Jeb Bush super PAC that spent heavily to tear down Bush rivals other than Trump.\n\n\u201cI thought it was an extremely large mistake on their part,\u201d he said of the super PAC.\n\nRomney, though, credited Trump with waging a politically savvy primary campaign. \u201cHe played it extremely well,\u201d he said, noting that the New York businessman had tapped into a deep vein of voter frustration. \u201cIt was a very effective strategy.\u201d\n\nAs he has on previous occasions, Romney warned that a Trump presidency could have disastrous repercussions for the country. But on Saturday, the former governor showed emotion. In explaining why he\u2019d decided to come out so forcefully against the party\u2019s presumptive nominee \u2014 and at a time when many GOP leaders are urging unity \u2014 Romney appeared to tear up.\n\nMany of the things Trump says, such as his criticism of a federal judge because of his Mexican heritage, just couldn\u2019t go unanswered, Romney said. \u201cSeeing this just breaks your heart.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Romney said he doesn\u2019t intend to regularly insert himself into the campaign. But he said he will speak out if Trump says something he disagrees with.\n\nWhen Blitzer pressed Romney on his plans, he revealed that he once thought that, had a candidate such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker or Bush won the White House, he could have held an administration role. With Trump and Hillary Clinton as the nominees, he joked that a Cabinet post was now unlikely.\n\nBut he hinted that there\u2019s a role he\u2019s anxious to embrace: that of a former GOP leader who will help to rebuild his party following a historically divisive election.\n\n\u201cI do believe, after November, I\u2019m going to be involved in articulating what the Republican Party stands for.\u201d\n\nTrump blasted Romney at a rally in Tampa, Florida, on Saturday, firing back at comments Romney made on Friday.\n\n\u201cPresidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickledown racism and trickledown bigotry and trickledown misogyny \u2014 all of these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI think his comments time and again appeal to the racist tendency that exists in some people, and I think that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure [Romney] knows what a misogynist is,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI am the least racist person that you have ever seen.\u201d\n\nThat followed a Saturday morning tweetstorm in which Trump asked how he could be a racist while having the support of \u201cso many\u201d African-Americans.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNow he calls me racist-but I am least racist person there is.\u201d\n\nAfrican-Americans like boxing promoter Don King, Trump continued, would not have endorsed him \u201cif they thought I was a racist!\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the New York Daily News asked King on the sidelines of Muhammad Ali\u2019s funeral whether he had in fact endorsed his longtime friend.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m endorsing the people.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI like Mr. Trump.

(Video: Reuters)\n\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nSen.-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) began 2019 by taking an unusual step for a Capitol Hill freshman: In an opinion essay written for The Washington Post, he attacked Donald Trump for failing to demonstrate the character needed for the office of the president of the United States. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Romney, of course, is not just any Senate newcomer. Nor is it novel for him to criticize President Trump. If anything, Romney\u2019s essay might have been expected, given that it comes at a time in his political career when he doesn\u2019t need Trump for anything.\n\nA review of Romney\u2019s interactions with Trump since the beginning of 2011 \u2014 a period covering both men\u2019s presidential bids and Romney\u2019s Senate race \u2014 makes clear that Romney\u2019s attacks on Trump are well attuned to the political thermostat. When he wanted Trump\u2019s support, for example in 2012, Romney refused to criticize Trump\u2019s birtherism \u2014 unlike his strong criticism of Trump in summer 2017 after the president waffled on criticizing self-proclaimed white nationalists at a rally in Virginia.\n\nIn reviewing the past eight years of interactions between the two, we assigned a rough value for how warm or cold relations were between the two (an admittedly subjective analysis). Roughly speaking, the periods in which Romney has spoken most warmly about Trump correlate to moments when Romney was seeking political office to which Trump might contribute. An exception was shortly after Trump took office, when Romney offered his support for Trump\u2019s success.\n\nHere\u2019s how Romney and Trump\u2019s relationship has evolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 2011\n\nIn an interview on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d in which he floated the idea of running for president, Trump first raises questions about President Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship.\n\n\u201cEverybody that even gives any hint of being a birther \u2014 a word you didn\u2019t use \u2014 even a little bit of a hint, like, gee, you know, maybe, just maybe, this much of a chance: They label them as an idiot,\u201d Donald Trump tells the network\u2019s Ashleigh Banfield when she asks whether he thinks Obama was born in the United States. After insisting that he was not an idiot, Trump explains his purported rationale:\n\n\u201cThe reason I have a little doubt \u2014 just a little! \u2014 is because he grew up, and nobody knew him. When you interview people \u2014 if I ever got the nomination, if I ever decide to run \u2014 you may go back and interview people from my kindergarten, they\u2019ll remember me. Nobody ever comes forward. Nobody knows who he is until later in his life. Very strange. The whole thing is very strange.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 12, 2011\n\nThe day after announcing his 2012 candidacy, Romney dismisses Trump\u2019s birtherism in an interview on CNBC.\n\n\u201cI think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States,\u201d Romney tells host Larry Kudlow, now a member of Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cThe man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn\u2019t the reason why.\u201d\n\nApril 19, 2011\n\n\u201cMitt Romney was a small business guy if you really think about it,\u201d Trump says in an interview on CNN. \u201cHe was a hedge fund. He was a funds guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn\u2019t create. \u2026 He\u2019d buy companies; he\u2019d close companies; he\u2019d get rid of jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much bigger than this man and have a much, much bigger net worth. I mean my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney,\u201d Trump adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrific guy, and I wish him the very best,\u201d Romney responds on Fox News. \u201cI hope he runs. Come on in, the water\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nMay 2011\n\nTrump\u2019s theoretical presidential bid is submarined after gaining little traction in polls and after Obama mocks him relentlessly at the White House correspondents' dinner.\n\nOn May 16, Trump announces that he will not run.\n\nSeptember 2011\n\nTrump and Romney meet in New York. Romney describes the meeting on \u201cMorning Joe\":\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t eat lunch together, but we did spend time together,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoy Donald Trump; he was colorful.\u201d\n\nLate 2011\n\nTrump agrees to moderate a debate among the Republican candidates hosted by the conservative site Newsmax and slated for the end of December.\n\nDec. 6, 2011\n\nRomney joins other candidates in declining to participate in Trump\u2019s debate.

I mean, he wants it very badly.\"\n\nFeb. 2, 2012\n\nAt an event in Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, he offers Romney that endorsement. The timing was important: The Nevada primary was looming, and Newt Gingrich had surged in national polling. The endorsement itself probably didn\u2019t make much of a difference, though: Romney won the state by 29 points over Gingrich.\n\n\"There are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life,\u201d Romney says, after Trump hands it off to him. \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d He goes on to say that being in Trump's hotel and getting his endorsement is a \u201cdelight.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMay 2012\n\nRomney declines to disavow Trump's comments about Obama.\n\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is they don\u2019t all agree with everything I believe in,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I need to get 50.1 percent or more, and I\u2019m appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people.\u201d\n\n2012\n\nRomney wins the nomination.

The two are photographed somewhat awkwardly sharing a dinner at a restaurant at a Trump hotel in Manhattan.\n\nAfter the dinner, Romney says that the conversation was \u201cenlightening and interesting and engaging\u201d and that Trump\u2019s picks for his administration gave him \u201cincreasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\u201d\n\nRomney reportedly was asked to apologize for his rhetoric about Trump during the campaign, an apology he refused to offer. Trump gave the job to ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson.\n\nEarly 2017\n\nAfter Trump takes office, Romney offers him his support, saying in a February interview that \u201cwhat people recognize is that he's doing what he said he'd do. I'm sure that's very encouraging to a lot of people. I think all of us, whether we are for him or someone else, have high hopes for our president.\"\n\nBut he also stands by his critiques: \u201cI expressed honestly what my belief was with regards to temperament and character.\u201d\n\nAug. 19, 2017\n\nAfter Trump equates anti-racist protesters with self-proclaimed white nationalists and Nazis rallying in Charlottesville, Romney calls for Trump to change his tune.\n\n\u201cHis apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard,\u201d Romney writes on Facebook, calling it a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for Trump. \u201cBut what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\u201d\n\nDecember 2017\n\nTrump visits Utah for the first time as president, the red state that saw the most significant erosion for the Republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. During the visit, Trump goes out of his way to praise Utah Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R), against whom Romney was rumored to be planning a primary challenge.\n\nIn Alabama, Republican Roy Moore hopes to win a special election to serve in the U.S. Senate \u2014 but his campaign is hobbled by allegations that he\u2019d had inappropriate sexual contact with a teen girl several decades before. Trump remains stalwart in his support for Moore. Romney, on the other hand, says that Moore would be a \u201cstain on the GOP and on the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity,\u201d he writes on Twitter.\n\nFeb. 16\n\nAfter Hatch announces that he plans to retire, Romney announces that he will run for the Utah seat.\n\nTrump endorses him.\n\nJune\n\nAfter Romney easily wins the primary, Trump tweets his praise for Romney and his family.\n\nBig and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2018\n\nNov. 6\n\nRomney wins election.\n\nJan. 1\n\nAs he prepares to take his position as Utah's junior senator, Romney writes an opinion essay for The Post in which he excoriates Trump \u2014 personally, if not on policy.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit,\u201d Romney writes. \u201cWith the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\u201d\n\nJan. 2\n\nTrump responds on Twitter.\n\nHere we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn\u2019t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN! \u2014 Donald J.
