The White House has struggled for months to dispel suggestions that Trump was unwilling to stand up to Russia.\n\nAsked if he believed U.S. intelligence agencies, which concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump said he was not convinced it was Moscow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPresident Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\u201d\n\nDan Coats, Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, promptly made clear he did not share the president\u2019s view. \u201cWe have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe news conference also rattled some officials in the State and Defense Departments and in U.S. intelligence agencies, according to officials in five government offices.\n\nSome career diplomats also expressed alarm. Bill Burns, a former U.S. deputy secretary of state and ambassador to Russia, said in a telephone interview: \u201cI have ... seen a lot of performances by presidents on the world stage, but I cannot think of one that was more appalling than this one.\u201d\n\nHours after the Helsinki summit, Trump tweeted: \u201cI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people. However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past - as the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!\u201d\n\n\u2018RUSSIA IS NOT OUR ALLY\u2019\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan denounced Trump\u2019s performance as \u201ctreasonous,\u201d and Republican U.S. Senator John McCain called the meeting with Putin a \u201ctragic mistake,\u201d although some other Republicans were more cautious.\n\nOther congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who until now had issued only muted criticism of Trump\u2019s attitude toward Russia, were more critical on Monday.\n\nRyan, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was tempered in his remarks but insisted that Trump \u201cmust appreciate that Russia is not our ally.\u201d\n\n\u201cMissed opportunity by President Trump to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling and deliver a strong warning regarding future elections,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Twitter. \u201cThis answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves.\u201d\n\nBut Republican Senator Rand Paul defended Trump, telling CNN: \u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m with the president on this; the (U.S.) intelligence community was full of biased people.\u201d\n\nSlideshow ( 19 images )\n\nThe White House said Trump would meet with members of Congress on Tuesday. It gave no further details.\n\n\u2018FOOLISHNESS AND STUPIDITY\u2019\n\nBefore the summit even began, Trump blamed his own country for the deterioration in relations.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nSlideshow ( 19 images )\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted back: \u201cWe agree\u201d.\n\nAt the news conference, Trump was invited by reporters to offer any criticism of Russia, but he repeatedly declined. Asked if Russia was at all to blame for the poor ties, he said: \u201cI hold both countries responsible. I think the U.S. has been foolish. We\u2019ve all been foolish,\u201d he said, before veering into a discussion about his election victory.\n\n\u201cI beat Hillary Clinton easily and frankly we beat her ... we won that race and it\u2019s a shame that there can be even a little bit of a cloud over it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s warm words for Russia were a marked contrast from the past week, when he repeatedly rebuked long-standing U.S. allies at a NATO summit and during a visit to Britain.\n\nAsked if Putin was an adversary, he said: \u201cActually I called him a competitor, and a good competitor he is, and I think the word competitor is a compliment.\u201d\n\nTrump also refrained from publicly criticizing Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, another geopolitical win for Putin against Western efforts to isolate him.\n\nPutin spoke of the importance of the two countries working together and praised Trump, at one point interrupting the news conference to give the U.S. president a soccer ball.\n\nAsked whether he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 election and had instructed officials to help him, Putin said: \u201cYes I did,\u201d although he denied any interference, saying the allegations were \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nPutin suggested U.S. investigators might travel to Russia to participate in questioning Russians accused by Washington of U.S. election meddling as long as Russian investigators were allowed to do the same with U.S. spies operating in Russia, an idea Trump\u2019s critics dismissed as ludicrous.\n\nThe summit capped a trip abroad during which Trump accused NATO allies of failing to spend enough on their militaries and embarrassed British Prime Minister Theresa May by saying she refused to take his advice about how to negotiate Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He referred to the European Union as a \u201cfoe\u201d in trade and repeatedly criticized it.\n\nIn some of the strongest words yet reflecting the unease of Washington\u2019s traditional allies, Germany\u2019s foreign minister said on Monday that Europe could no longer rely on the United States.\n\n\u201cTo maintain our partnership with the USA we must readjust it,\u201d Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper group. \u201cThe first clear consequence can only be that we need to align ourselves even more closely in Europe.\u201d", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-summit-idUSKBN1K601D"}, "article2": {"title": "Trump Discussed Pulling U.S. From NATO, Aides Say Amid New Concerns Over Russia", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desires more than the weakening of NATO, the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.\n\nLast year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying NATO: the withdrawal of the United States.\n\nSenior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.\n\nIn the days around a tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html"}, "article3": {"title": "Helsinki summit: Trump sides with Putin over US intelligence", "content": "Helsinki, Finland CNN \u2014\n\nUS President Donald Trump, in a stunning rebuke of the US intelligence community, declined on Monday to endorse the US government\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201csee any reason why\u201d Russia would be responsible.\n\nInstead, Trump \u2013 standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 touted Putin\u2019s vigorous denial and pivoted to complaining about the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server and missing emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal account.\n\n\u201cI have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,\u201d Trump said during a joint news conference after he spent about two hours in a room alone with Putin, save for a pair of interpreters.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements amounted to an unprecedented refusal by a US president to believe his own intelligence agencies over the word of a foreign adversary and drew swift condemnation from across the partisan divide.\n\nHis words signaled that he continues to equate the assessment of Russian election meddling with efforts to deligitimize his election, even though the US intelligence community made no such assessment.\n\nThe US President also hailed Putin\u2019s offer for Russian law enforcement officials to interrogate the Russian agents indicted by the special counsel Robert Mueller as \u201cincredible,\u201d an offer that would effectively give Russia oversight and influence of part of a US investigation into Russian state activities. Putin had also said the offer would be reciprocal.\n\nTrump repeatedly equated US and Russian actions, saying he holds both the US and Russia responsible for the breakdown in the bilateral relationship and homed in on the effect of the special counsel\u2019s probe, saying it \u2013 not Russian meddling \u2013 has \u201ckept us (the US and Russia) apart.\u201d\n\nThe US intelligence community \u2013 in a report compiled by the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2013 concluded with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russia interfered during the 2016 presidential campaign, aiming to help elect Trump and hurt Clinton.\n\nEvery current US intelligence chief who has testified on the matter has also backed the intelligence community\u2019s assessment and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee also affirmed the assessment in a report earlier this month.\n\nTrump had previously said he sided with his intelligence community\u2019s assessment over Putin\u2019s denials, but he has more frequently cast doubt on the assessments and repeatedly assailed Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nPutin, for his part, reiterated his denial for the public, though he did admit for the first time that he wanted Trump to win the election.\n\n\u201cRussia has never interfered in and is not going to interfere in US internal affairs, including the elections,\u201d Putin said during the news conference. \u201cIf there are any specific materials, if they are presented, we are ready to review them together.\u201d\n\nTrump, aboard Air Force One returning back to Washington, belatedly attempted to quell outrage over his earlier remarks saying he has confidence in his own intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cAs I said today and many times before, \u201cI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.\u201d However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past \u2013 as the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nAs I said today and many times before, \u201cI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.\u201d However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past \u2013 as the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018\n\nBut it was his own pick \u2013 Dan Coats, the Director of National Intelligence \u2013 who warned on Friday that \u201cthe warning lights are blinking red again\u201d regarding Russian cyber interference. Coats then defended the US intelligence community\u2019s assessment about the 2016 election in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,\u201d Coats said.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike pushed back on Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who rarely rebukes Trump\u2019s controversial statements, said \u201cthere is no question that Russia interfered in our elections\u201d and called on Trump to recognize that Russia \u201cis not our ally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President must appreciate that Russia is not our ally. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,\u201d Ryan said in a statement.\n\nOther Republicans were even more critical, with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker saying Trump\u2019s comments \u201cmade us look like a pushover.\u201d\n\nJohn Brennan, the former CIA director and a career intelligence officer, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cnothing short of treasonous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of \u2018high crimes & misdemeanors,\u2019 \u201d Brennan tweeted. \u201cIt was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???\u201d\n\nMeeting runs long\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump and Putin blew past the 90 minutes they were scheduled to spend with only interpreters at their sides on Monday, just hours after the US President blamed US policy for the dismal state of relations between the two countries.\n\nAfter their initial meeting, the two leaders brought in their top aides for an expanded bilateral meeting, the next step in their first official summit, and then concluded with a joint news conference.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump again lambasted the special counsel\u2019s investigation stemming from Russian interference in the 2016 election as \u201ca disaster for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the probe is a disaster for our country. I think it\u2019s kept us (the US and Russia) apart. I think it\u2019s kept us separated,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe US President proclaimed in front of Putin that \u201cthere was no collusion\u201d during the 2016 campaign and said he \u201cbeat Hillary Clinton easily.\u201d\n\nHe added the Mueller probe has \u201chad a negative impact on the relationship between the two nuclear powers.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump dove into specifics on US missteps, he did not list any malignant Russian activities responsible for the low point in the US-Russia relationship.\n\nInstead he said he holds both the United States and Russia responsible for the breakdown in the relationship between the two countries and railed against the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. We\u2019ve all been foolish,\u201d Trump said at the news conference in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\u201cWe should have, frankly, had this dialogue a long time ago. I think that we\u2019re all to blame. I think that the United States has now stepped forward along with Russia,\u201d Trump said, adding that he feels that the US and Russia have \u201cboth made some mistakes.\u201d\n\nHistoric summit\n\nGathered at the Finnish presidential palace, a historic venue where previous US presidents have also gathered with their Russian and Soviet counterparts to tackle the complex bilateral relationship, Trump made clear at the outset that he hopes the meeting can help transform the relationship into an \u201cextraordinary\u201d one.\n\n\u201cI think we have great opportunities together as two countries that, frankly, we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years,\u201d said Trump, who is hoping his personal touch can reverse the steep decline. \u201cI think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship.\u201d\n\nBut the highly anticipated meetings that had been minutely planned began with a sluggish start after the Russian President arrived late, setting the summit about 45 minutes back.\n\nPutin is known for arriving late to important events \u2013 considered a power play by some observers \u2013 but this time his late arrival offered a role reversal for the US President, who has recently walked in late to meetings at the G7 and NATO summits.\n\nIn 2009 and 2012, Putin showed up about 40 and 45 minutes late for his meetings with then-President Barack Obama. But he kept German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych waiting about four hours each in 2014 and 2012, respectively. Even the Pope waited more than an hour for Putin to show up at the Vatican in 2015.\n\nThe two men walked into the palace\u2019s Gothic Hall together, offering brief remarks and shaking hands for the cameras before the two men were left alone \u2013 save for a pair of interpreters \u2013 for the first meeting of the day.\n\nTrump and Putin had set aside 90 minutes of solo time \u2013 just as Trump did with Kim Jong Un last month. But the two men spilled into overtime, inviting reporters for the start of their expanded bilateral meeting with top aides 2 hours and 11 minutes after their one-on-one meeting began. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, White House chief of staff John Kelly, Fiona Hill, the top Russia expert at the National Security Council, and interpreter Marina Gross.\n\nThe lengthy t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate made Trump\u2019s remarks ahead of the meeting all the more notable \u2013 and concerning to some.\n\nImproving US-Russia ties\n\nUS officials have stressed the path to improving US-Russia ties runs through a clear-eyed understanding of Russian aggression and the root causes of discord in the relationship, but Trump is signaling a different course. He is holding previous US administrations and the Justice Department\u2019s investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election responsible.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning ahead of the summit.\n\nOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018\n\nTrump was eager to have time alone with Putin to better personally assess him and develop a personal relationship, according to a US official, but he has also expressed anger at leaks from his meetings with foreign leaders and told aides he wanted to ensure his sensitive discussions with Putin remained secret.\n\nThe official also said that Trump doesn\u2019t want aides \u2013 who may take a harder line on Russia \u2013 undercutting or interrupting him during his talks with Putin.\n\nJust days earlier, Trump pointed to the \u201cpure stupidity\u201d and a \u201cpolitical problem\u201d in the United States for making it \u201cvery hard to do something with Russia.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Remnick: Putin wants to 'throw US off balance' 08:28 - Source: CNN\n\n\u201cAnything you do, it\u2019s always going to be, \u2018Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,\u2019 \u201d Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart.\n\nTrump\u2019s Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among US allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized US allies, called the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department\u2019s indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats\u2019 emails and computer networks during the 2016 election.\n\nAhead of his meeting with Putin \u2013 who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents \u2013 the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-putin-helsinki-summit/index.html"}}
