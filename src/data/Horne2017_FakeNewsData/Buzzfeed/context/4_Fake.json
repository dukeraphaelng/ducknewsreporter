Trump, behind in the polls, seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,\u201d the Republican nominee told a riled-up crowd in Columbus, Ohio. He was hearing \u201cmore and more\u201d about evidence of rigging, he added, leaving the details to his supporters\u2019 imagination.\n\nA few weeks later, Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash, sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out. In a dubious art just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece.\n\nMr. Harris started by crafting the headline: \u201cBREAKING: \u2018Tens of thousands\u2019 of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.\u201d It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his \u201crigged\u201d meme.\n\n\u201cI had a theory when I sat down to write it,\u201d recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. \u201cGiven the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump\u2019s talking points people would click.

Rating: About this rating False\n\nOn 30 September 2016, the Christian Times Newspaper (CTN) web site published an article reporting that \"tens of thousands\" of pre-marked ballots cast for Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates had been discovered stored in an Ohio warehouse:\n\nElection officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week. According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates. Clinton campaign\u2019s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.\n\nThere is no truth to the above-quoted story.\n\nChristian Times Newspaper's report described the above-displayed photograph as showing \"Randall Prince\" with his discovery of pre-marked Clinton ballots, but this picture was actually taken in 2015 in Birmingham, England, and simply captures a man unloading a truck of ballot boxes at a polling station. It appears that CTN altered the photograph (removing \"Ballot Box\" from some of the boxes and reversing the image) in an apparent attempt to make it difficult to find the original picture:\n\nAlthough CTN presents itself as a legitimate publication (by imitating the name of the genuine Christian Times newspaper), the web site has invented and promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including false stories reporting that Donald Trump was removed from primary ballots, that Clinton said \"Harambe\" was a victim of racism, that an African-American Trump supporter was killed in Chicago, and that the 4th of July had been cancelled due to fears of terrorism.\n\nWhile the web site does not explicitly label their content as fiction, they do carry a disclaimer exempting themselves from responsibility for their efforts:", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-votes-found-in-warehouse/"}}
