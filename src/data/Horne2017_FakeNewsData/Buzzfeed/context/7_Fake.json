Khan, a Muslim American soldier, was killed in Iraq in 2004 when he ran toward a suicide bomber, saving the lives of the men he was in charge of. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Khizr Khan, the soldier's father, told the story of his son's life and sacrifice powerfully at the convention \u2014 while chiding Donald Trump for his comments about banning Muslims from entering the country. Trump attacked Khan as a Democratic shill, playing on grief to help elect Clinton.\n\nKhizr Khan is back. This ad, released by the Clinton campaign on Friday afternoon, features Khan telling his story again.\n\nHillary Clinton: 'Captain Khan' | Campaign 2016 (Video: Hillary Clinton)\n\nIt shows Khan walking through his home, looking at his son's medals and pictures. The 60-second ad ends with a close-up of a teary-eyed Khan saying this: \u201cI want to ask Mr. Trump: Would my son have a place in your America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a remarkably powerful ad, connecting Trump's rhetoric on Muslims to the real pain that such a pledge would inflict on Muslim Americans. Real people would be affected by all of these proposals, the ad reminds us. It's not just words by Trump.\n\nThe ad, according to the Clinton campaign, will rotate into swing states, including Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nI'm not sure that any ad fundamentally alters the trajectory of this race. TV commercials have become less relevant as the number of people watching traditional television live has declined. Plus, Clinton and Trump are totally known figures about whom very few people lack an opinion.\n\nBut if there is an ad that breaks through the clutter while also reminding people of the stakes in the election, this might be the one.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end Share Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn MailSolid Email this link View Photos View Photos Next Image MANHATTAN, NY - The morning after loosing to Republican Nominee Donald Trump in the general Presidential election, Democratic Nominee for President of the United States former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, accompanied by former President Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine and Anne Holton, speaks to supporters and campaign staff in a packed ballroom at The New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York on Wednesday November 9, 2016.

Humayun Khan\u2019s, life.\n\n\u201cIn 2004, my son was stationed in Iraq. He saw a suicide bomber approaching his camp. My son moved forward to stop the bomber when the bomb exploded.

She had nothing to say. She probably \u2013 maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.
