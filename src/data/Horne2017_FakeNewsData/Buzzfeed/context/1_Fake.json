Rating: About this rating False\n\nFake news occasionally proves itself to be more amusing than annoying (i.e., actual satire rather than an attempt to fool readers with sensationalist clickbait), and an August 2016 article from the Nevada County Scooper hit that mark \u2014 deftly blending political controversies over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server, suggestions of election fraud, and claims by supporters of rival Bernie Sanders that their candidate had been cheated out of the nomination by a partisan Democratic National Committee into one short article that began:\n\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton is in hot water again after nearly 5 million uncounted California electronic ballots were found on her email server by the F.B.I. The majority of those ballots cast were by Bernie Sanders supporters. The election commission has an emergency meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to discuss a possible vote recount which will include the newly-found ballots. Ms. Clinton has already come under fire during this election cycle over using her private email server for personal use, including storing and sending classified information with it. There has been a formal investigation, but no charges have been filed in that case. Some of the charges are facing several charges.\n\n\n\nAlas for those who might wish to believe that some or all of the above is true, the Nevada County Scooper's \"Manifesto\" notes that the site is all about fake news and satire:", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/uncounted-sanders-ballots-clinton/"}, "article2": {"title": "What Happened: The long list of who Hillary Clinton blames", "content": "Did it matter? If what we know Russia did is all that Russia actually did, then it almost certainly wasn't enough to hand Mr Trump the election (although it is, and should be, a major cause for concern going forward).

Of course, the Democrat had plenty of those kind of organisations at her disposal - and vastly outspent her opponent - and she still lost.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41244474"}, "article3": {"title": "Comey made announcement on Clinton email probe days before election to give himself 'cover': Trump spokesperson", "content": "\"The guy knew exactly what he was doing,\" White House spokeswoman said.\n\nJames Comey\u2019s acknowledgement that he may have subconsciously expected Hillary Clinton to win the presidency when he disclosed days before the 2016 election the reopening of a probe of her emails shows that the then-FBI chief was driven by political motivation and self-interest, a White House spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe guy knew exactly what he was doing,\u201d White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cHe thought that Hillary Clinton would win, and he thought that this would give him some cover.
