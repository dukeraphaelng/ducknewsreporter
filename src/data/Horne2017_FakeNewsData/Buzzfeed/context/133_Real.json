{"foreign_id": "133_Real", "article1": {"title": "Tracking turnover in the Trump administration", "content": "Sections Print\n\nEditor's note: Because Donald Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House has ended, this page will no longer be updated. It will remain in its current state as a resource for historical data.\n\nThe rate of turnover among senior-level advisers to President Trump has generated a great deal of attention. Below, we offer two sets of resources to help measure and contextualize this turnover. The first set of resources tracks turnover among senior-ranking advisers in the executive office of the president (which does not include Cabinet secretaries); the second set of resources tracks turnover in the Cabinet. Turnover on the president\u2019s \u201cA Team\u201d President Trump\u2019s \u201cA Team\u201d turnover is 92% as of January 20, 2021 The following chart and table reflect turnover among the most influential positions within the executive office of the president. This data is compiled and tracked by Brookings Nonresident Senior Fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who refers to this group of advisers as the president\u2019s \u201cA Team.\u201d The list of positions that make up the \u201cA Team\u201d is based on National Journal \u201cDecision Makers\u201d editions, and Dunn Tenpas\u2019s methodology is described in detail in a report she published in January 2018. The chart and table below will be updated as additional members of the \u201cA Team\u201d depart their positions. It is important to note the following: Because the \u201cA Team\u201d is made up of members of the executive office of the president, it does not include Cabinet secretaries.\n\nEach position on the \u201cA Team\u201d is only counted once. If multiple people hold and depart from the same position (e.g., communications director), only the initial departure is tracked/affects the turnover rate. For more information on these instances, see the \u201cserial turnover\u201d section below.\n\nSummary and analysis of \u201cA Team\u201d turnover in the Trump administration Set out below is a list of the senior level departures from the executive office of the president since the beginning of the Trump administration (each of the 65 \u201cA Team\u201d positions is only counted once toward the turnover rate, thus, this chart only includes the first person to hold/depart a given position). Highlighted text indicates a position that went through multiple instances of turnover; see below for more details.

In the end, the category \u201cresigned under pressure\u201d was created to capture the general sentiment at the time of their departure. Highlighted text indicates a position that went through multiple instances of turnover; see the \u201cSerial turnover\u201d section below for more details. ** Author\u2019s note: Anthony Scaramucci was communications director for 11 days. He was succeeded by Hope Hicks, who resigned Feb. 28, 2018. On July 5, 2018, Bill Shine was appointed to the White House communications director role with a slightly different official title, \u201cAssistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications\u201d; he resigned on March 8, 2019. Stephanie Grisham subsequently took over both the communications director and press secretary roles. *** Author\u2019s note: After Thomas Bossert\u2019s departure, incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton folded the position of \u201cAP for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\u201d into the National Security Council with the new title of \u201cHomeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor.\u201d Sources: Multiple news websites, LinkedIn, WhiteHouse.gov, and other government websites. Serial turnover within the Trump \u201cA Team\u201d The turnover data above include only the president\u2019s initial team of advisers and when one departs, the position falls out of the sample. One of the limitations of this approach is that it does not consider multiple departures within a single position, a common phenomenon within the Trump team. Set out below are the \u201cA Team\u201d positions that have had more than two occupants. 45% of President Trump\u2019s \u201cA Team\u201d departures have undergone serial turnover as of January 20, 2021 Position Original Replacement 1 Replacement 2 Replacement 3 Replacement 4 Replacement 5 Replacement 6 Chief of Staff Reince Priebus John Kelly Mick Mulvaney (acting) Mark Meadows Deputy Chief of Staff** Katie Walsh Kirstjen Nielsen Zachary Fuentes Emma Doyle John Fleming Chief of Staff to the VP Josh Pitcock Nick Ayers Marc Short Chief of Staff to the First Lady Lindsay Reynolds Stephanie Grisham Unknown Communications Director* Michael Dubke Anthony Scaramucci Hope Hicks Bill Shine Stephanie Grisham Alyssa Farah Unknown Press Secretary Sean Spicer Sarah Huckabee Sanders Stephanie Grisham Kayleigh McEnany Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks Mercedes Schlapp Unknown Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders Raj Shah Hogan Gidley Brian R.

The data reflect an attempt to track just a single deputy position and note the successor. However, there is minimal publicly available information on presidential staffing. It is also the case that a new chief of staff may not have a \u201cfirst among equals\u201d deputy chief of staff, such that the role may have changed since the original occupant. The same is true for White House Counsel. While Greg Katsas may have been the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d among the Deputy White House Counsel positions in 2017, the role may have changed under the new White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone. *** Author\u2019s note: Upon the departure of former Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman, National Security Adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien divided the duties of that position between Matthew Pottinger and Victoria Coates. On Feb. 20, 2020, the National Security Council said that Coates had left the position and been reassigned as a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette; on Jan. 7, reports indicated that Pottinger had resigned. Turnover in the president\u2019s Cabinet The chart and table below are dedicated to tracking turnover in the Cabinet. They will also be updated as additional turnover occurs.

Although an honest and honorable man, Andrew Johnson was one of the most unfortunate of Presidents. Arrayed against him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly led and ruthless in their tactics. Johnson was no match for them.\n\nBorn in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1808, Johnson grew up in poverty. He was apprenticed to a tailor as a boy, but ran away. He opened a tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, married Eliza McCardle, and participated in debates at the local academy.\n\nEntering politics, he became an adept stump speaker, championing the common man and vilifying the plantation aristocracy. As a Member of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 1840\u2019s and \u201950\u2019s, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for the poor man.\n\nDuring the secession crisis, Johnson remained in the Senate even when Tennessee seceded, which made him a hero in the North and a traitor in the eyes of most Southerners. In 1862 President Lincoln appointed him Military Governor of Tennessee, and Johnson used the state as a laboratory for reconstruction. In 1864 the Republicans, contending that their National Union Party was for all loyal men, nominated Johnson, a Southerner and a Democrat, for Vice President.\n\nAfter Lincoln\u2019s death, President Johnson proceeded to reconstruct the former Confederate States while Congress was not in session in 1865. He pardoned all who would take an oath of allegiance, but required leaders and men of wealth to obtain special Presidential pardons.\n\nBy the time Congress met in December 1865, most southern states were reconstructed, slavery was being abolished, but \u201cblack codes\u201d to regulate the freedmen were beginning to appear.\n\nRadical Republicans in Congress moved vigorously to change Johnson\u2019s program. They gained the support of northerners who were dismayed to see Southerners keeping many prewar leaders and imposing many prewar restrictions upon Negroes.\n\nThe Radicals\u2019 first step was to refuse to seat any Senator or Representative from the old Confederacy. Next they passed measures dealing with the former slaves. Johnson vetoed the legislation. The Radicals mustered enough votes in Congress to pass legislation over his veto\u2013the first time that Congress had overridden a President on an important bill. They passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which established Negroes as American citizens and forbade discrimination against them.\n\nA few months later Congress submitted to the states the Fourteenth Amendment, which specified that no state should \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d\n\nAll the former Confederate States except Tennessee refused to ratify the amendment; further, there were two bloody race riots in the South. Speaking in the Middle West, Johnson faced hostile audiences. The Radical Republicans won an overwhelming victory in Congressional elections that fall.\n\nIn March 1867, the Radicals effected their own plan of Reconstruction, again placing southern states under military rule. They passed laws placing restrictions upon the President. When Johnson allegedly violated one of these, the Tenure of Office Act, by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House voted eleven articles of impeachment against him. He was tried by the Senate in the spring of 1868 and acquitted by one vote.\n\nIn 1875, Tennessee returned Johnson to the Senate. He died a few months later.\n\nLearn more about Andrew Johnson\u2019s spouse, Eliza McCardle Johnson.", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/andrew-johnson/"}, "article3": {"title": "Contenders for key jobs in Trump administration", "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump held talks on Saturday with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a meeting between famous foes fueling speculation that Romney could be in line to be the new U.S. secretary of state.\n\nFormer Republican U.S. presidential nominee Mitt Romney at a campaign rally in North Canton, Ohio March 14, 2016.
