Follow him @joshuamzeitz.\n\nAs his first year in the White House draws to a close, Donald J. Trump remains in almost every respect a singular character. He exists well outside the boundaries of what most observers previously judged possible, let alone respectable, in American politics. To catalogue the norms he has violated, the traditions he has traduced or trampled, and the rules\u2014written and unwritten\u2014that he has either cunningly sidestepped or audaciously blown to smithereens would require volumes. Love him or loathe him, Trump operates apart from history.\n\nYet if Trump defies history, paradoxically, he has also resurfaced questions that historians have long debated, including some that many considered settled for many years. In this sense, Trump hasn\u2019t just defied history; he has changed it\u2014and he has changed the way that we think about it, forcing us to look back on our past with a new lens.\n\nThis Politico Magazine series, to be published in three installments over the next few weeks, will look at three historical debates that simmered on low heat for years, until the historic presidential election of November 2016 brought them back to a boil. These debates are foundational. They concern race and identity. National character. The dark side of populism. They drive at the core meaning of American citizenship.\n\nThe first in this series, perhaps the most fundamental, centers around the white working class. Are working-class white voters shooting themselves in the foot by making common cause with a political movement that is fundamentally inimical to their economic self-interest? In exchange for policies like the new tax bill, which several nonpartisan analyses conclude will lower taxes on the wealthy and raise them for the working class, did they really just settle for a wall that will likely never be built, a rebel yell for Confederate monuments most of them will never visit, and the hollow validation of a disappearing world in which white was up and brown and black were down?\n\nIf they did accept that bargain, why? Or are we missing something? Might working-class whites in fact derive some tangible advantage from their bargain with Trump? Is it really so irrational to care more about, say, illegal immigration than marginal income tax rates?\n\nThese are good questions. They\u2019re also not new ones. The historian W.E.B. Du Bois asked them more than 80 years ago in his seminal work on Reconstruction, when he posited that working-class Southern whites were complicit, or at least passive instruments, in their own political and economic disenfranchisement. They forfeited real power and material well-being, he argued, in return for the \u201cpsychological\u201d wages associated with being white.\n\nSince then, the issue has inspired a vibrant debate among historians. Until last year, most agreed with Du Bois that the answer to the question was not so simple as \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\u2014that whiteness sometimes conferred benefits both imaginary and real.\n\nIn the age of Trump, we\u2019re once again pressure-testing Du Bois\u2019 framework. As one might expect, it\u2019s complicated. White identity pays dividends you can easily bank, and some that you can\u2019t.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 1935 Du Bois published his most influential treatise, Black Reconstruction, a reconsideration of the period immediately following the Civil War. One of the historical quandaries that Du Bois addressed was the successful effort of white plantation owners in the 1870s and \u201980s to build a political coalition with poor, often landless, white men to overthrow biracial Reconstruction governments throughout the South.\n\n\u201cThe theory of laboring class unity rests upon the assumption that laborers, despite internal jealousies, will unite because of their opposition to the exploitation of the capitalists,\u201d wrote Du Bois, who trained at both the University of Berlin and Harvard, and whose grounding in Marxist political economy taught him to view politics through the lens of different but fixed stages in capitalist development. \u201cThis would throw white and black labor into one class,\u201d he continued, \u201cand precipitate a united fight for higher wages and better working conditions.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is not what happened. In most Southern states, poor whites and wealthy whites forged a coalition that overthrew biracial Reconstruction governments and passed a raft of laws that greatly benefited plantation and emerging industrial elites at the expense of small landowners, tenant farmers and factory workers. \u201cIt failed to work because the theory of race was supplemented by a carefully planned and slowly evolved method,\u201d Du Bois wrote, \u201cwhich drove such a wedge between white and black workers that there probably are not today in the world two groups of workers with practically identical interests who hate and fear each other so deeply and persistently and who are kept so far apart that neither sees anything of common interest.\u201d\n\nDu Bois famously posited that \u201cthe white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white.\u201d\n\nDecades before so many white working-class citizens of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin\u2014to say nothing of Alabama, West Virginia and Mississippi\u2014cast their lot with a party that endeavors to raise their taxes and gut their health care, Du Bois identified the problem: Some wages aren\u2019t denominated in hard currency. They carry a psychological payoff\u2014even a spiritual one.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe most obvious time and place to pressure-test Du Bois\u2019 theory is the Jim Crow South. In the 60-odd years between the collapse of Reconstruction and World War II, the South\u2014still reeling from the Civil War, in which it lost the present-day equivalent of approximately $5.5 trillion in real property and wealth\u2014slipped into a semi-permanent state of economic crisis.\n\nIn 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt declared the region \u201cthe Nation\u2019s No. 1 economic problem.\u201d It was, as historian Gavin Wright famously observed, a \u201clow-wage region in a high-wage country,\u201d one where two-thirds of the population lived in small towns of fewer than 2,500 people, derived meager incomes from agriculture, mining or manufacturing, and even in the midst of a national depression, stood out for poor health, want of education and lack of opportunities for upward mobility.\n\nThe vast majority of farmers, black and white, were tenants or sharecroppers, and repressive poll taxes disenfranchised not just black men and women, but also poor white people. Designed by wealthy plantation owners and industrialists, the poll tax was expressly a class measure, meant to preserve the region\u2019s prevailing low-tax, low-wage, low-service economy. It was more ingenious and insidious than many people today realize. In Mississippi and Virginia, it was cumulative for two years; if a tenant farmer or textile worker couldn\u2019t pay in any given year, not only did he miss an election cycle, he had to pay a full two years\u2019 tax to restore his voting rights. In Georgia, the poll tax was cumulative from the time a voter turned 21 years old\u2014meaning, if one missed 10 years, he or she would have to pay a decade\u2019s worth of back taxes before regaining the right to vote. In Texas, the tax was due on February 1, in the winter off-season, when farmers were habitually strapped for cash. It was, as one Southern liberal observed at the time, \u201clike buying a ticket to a show nine months ahead of time, and before you know who\u2019s playing, or really what the thing is all about.\u201d\n\nLittle wonder that in 1936, three of four voting-age adults outside the South participated in the presidential election, but in the South, just one in four cast ballots. The system kept men like Eugene Cox, a conservative Democrat who held the powerful post of House Rules Committee chairman, in power. In 1938, Cox won reelection with 5,137 votes, though his district in southwest Georgia had a total population of 263,606 residents.\n\nYet when working-class Southern whites could participate in the political process, they often jettisoned their natural class interests in favor of racial solidarity. Historians have focused special attention on the rise and fall of the Readjuster movement, a biracial coalition that controlled the Legislature, governor\u2019s office and most federal posts in Virginia from 1879 to 1883. Forged in opposition to a conservative Democratic establishment that had shuttered schools, imposed regressive taxes and favored creditors over debtors, the alliance passed a raft of measures that presaged much of the Populist movement\u2019s agenda in coming years. For a time, it held. But in 1883, Democrats campaigned with intense focus on the issue of inter-marriage and miscegenation\u2014a rare phenomenon that nevertheless struck a raw nerve with white workers and farmers. They warned that Readjuster rule would result in \u201cmixed schools now and mixed marriages for the future.\u201d It worked. Conservative \u201cBourbon\u201d Democrats regained control of state government and reintroduced regressive, one-party rule that benefited a small minority of Virginians.\n\nTo reduce Jim Crow politics to a single trajectory is to oversimplify a complicated story. But the problem of white working-class Southerners bedeviled generations of liberal activists and historians. When the labor federation Congress of Industrial Organizations launched Operation Dixie, a massive effort to unionize Southern workers in the mid-1940s, organizers ran into the same wall: Conservative politicians and their wealthy patrons successfully used race as a cudgel to turn white workers away from collective bargaining agreements that would have raised their wages. Even those Southern populists who ostensibly opposed Bourbon rule\u2014from Georgia\u2019s Tom Watson in the early 20th century to Mississippi\u2019s Theodore Bilbo in the 1930s\u2014more often flipped the playbook and used race as a blunt instrument against their elite opponents.\n\nSouthern liberals in the 1930s and \u201940s applied a sharp class focus and concluded that wealthy Democrats wanted, in historian Gavin Wright\u2019s words, to keep labor \u201ccheap and divided.\u201d The white liberal writer Lillian E. Smith famously captured this thinking in her short story \u201cTwo Men and a Bargain,\u201d which began: \u201cOnce upon a time, down South, a rich white man made a bargain with a poor white ... \u2018You boss the nigger, and I\u2019ll boss the money.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nCritically, Du Bois never insisted that the psychological wages of whiteness were wholly devoid of tangible value. What they forfeited in material benefits, working-class whites also recouped in limited power and privilege. \u201cThey were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe police were drawn from their ranks. \u2026 The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule. On the other hand, the Negro was subject to insult; was afraid of mobs; was liable to the jibes of children and the unreasoning fears of white women; and was compelled almost continuously to submit to various badges of inferiority.\u201d You couldn\u2019t necessarily buy groceries with these benefits, but they were palpably meaningful.\n\nDavid Roediger, a historian of class and race who writes with a Marxian lens, emphasized exactly this point in his classic volume, The Wages of Whiteness, published in 1991 (the title was a direct tribute to Du Bois). He encouraged a generation of scholars to consider that working-class whites may not have been unwitting dupes in their own economic subjugation; instead, they knowingly harvested certain real advantages of whiteness. While this pattern was most visible in the South, it also deeply influenced political culture in the North and West, where whiteness was no less central to popular conceptions of American citizenship. And Roediger\u2019s focus was on Northern workers in antebellum cities\u2014workers undergoing the jarring transition from pre-industrial forms of work and leisure to a more regimented existence as wage laborers.\n\nThe workers whom Roediger describes, and whom dozens more scholars would similarly study, understood that American citizenship was predicated on race and independence; Congress, after all, had opened citizenship to all \u201cfree white persons\u201d in 1790. That law remained on the books into the 20th century. But what did it mean to be \u201cwhite?\u201d Congress never made that point clear. Indeed, there was no immediate consensus that certain new immigrants met the qualification. And what did it mean to be \u201cfree?\u201d Their new status as wage earners\u2014economically dependent on other men to earn a living\u2014seemingly made many working men and women something less than free. Many non-black workers keenly understood that they might be left outside the boundaries of citizenship. They also resented new forms of industrial discipline that their employers foisted onto them. Many addressed these anxieties by drawing a sharp dichotomy between white and black\u2014citizen and slave\u2014and placing themselves on one side of that divide.\n\nThey became avid purveyors of blackface minstrelsy\u2014a popular form of entertainment in which working-class whites reveled in watching other working-class whites apply burnt cork to their faces and act out what the historian George Rawick (writing more generally about early American racism) described as a \u201cpornography of [their] former [lives].\u201d The black characters they portrayed on stage were shiftless, sexually promiscuous and rowdy; they reveled in pre-industrial activities like hunting. They were coarse. In short, they deflected on black people, both slave and free, the very same social demerits that wealthier whites\u2014who were trying to impose new discipline on the urban working class\u2014ascribed to them.\n\nPlaybills commonly \u201cpaired pictures of the performers in blackface and without makeup\u2014rough and respectable,\u201d Roediger observed. The former were labeled, \u201cPlantation Darkeys.\u201d The latter, \u201cCitizens.\u201d By culturally differentiating themselves from black people, actors and audience members alike established themselves as \u201cfree white persons.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to imagine that working-class whites embraced the new racial dichotomy in order to enjoy leverage in the new urban job market, in many cases, black and white workers weren\u2019t even in competition with each other. Many of the most popular blackface actors were former artisans and mechanics\u2014coach makers, typesetters and wood craftsmen who were now increasingly likely to fall into \u201cwage slavery.\u201d They were unlikely to vie for employment with free black men, who were normally consigned to unskilled jobs as dockworkers, day laborers and (until Irish women displaced them) domestic servants.\n\nOne group that did sometimes compete for unskilled jobs with African-Americans were Irish immigrants. Regarded as racially suspect\u2014depicted in political cartoons as dark and ape-like, and patently unqualified for citizenship\u2014Irish immigrants became some of the most avid and violent practitioners of white identity politics. Even when they weren\u2019t in direct competition with black men for jobs\u2014as when a group of Irish hand-loom weavers was displaced by white Protestant weavers in Philadelphia in 1844\u2014they donned blackface and mobbed their black neighbors. The point wasn\u2019t to get their jobs back.\n\nIndeed, more was at stake than cash wages. To achieve standing as free white persons\u2014and to enjoy the many benefits of citizenship that accrued from that definition\u2014working-class men in the antebellum era consciously asserted their white identity and set it apart from blackness through language, performance, politics and violence. To imagine that they didn\u2019t understand the full impact of their decisions is to deny them any modicum of intelligence or agency.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIf working-class whites historically derived both psychological and citizenship wages by privileging race over class, is it possible that they sometimes enjoyed real wages as well? Beginning 25 years ago, a rising generation of political historians including Thomas Sugrue, Kevin Kruse, Matthew Lassiter, Robert Self and Craig Steven Wilder concluded that they did. Giving special focus to labor and housing markets, they found that many working-class white families benefited directly from government policies that placed African-Americans at a disadvantage.\n\nTake housing. Beginning in the 1930s, most mortgages were underwritten by the Federal Housing Administration, a federal agency that insured banks against losses from homeowners who defaulted on their loans. The FHA insured these mortgages in return for securing the banks\u2019 pledge to provide home loans at low interest rates and to spread interest payments over at least 15 and as many as 30 years to pay back their loans. At minimal expense to the federal government and with only the pledge of default insurance, the FHA freed up unprecedented levels of capital and helped create a postwar social order in which 60 percent of American households owned and accumulated wealth in their own homes.\n\nIn deciding whether or not to insure mortgages, the FHA rated every census tract in the country. Assuming that houses lost value in neighborhoods that were racially mixed or primarily populated by African-Americans and Latinos, the FHA assigned such areas lower scores or \u201credlined\u201d them altogether, refusing to insure mortgages in these neighborhoods or insuring them on unfavorable terms. This meant that most black Americans could not secure mortgages, as their mere presence in a neighborhood would choke off affordable credit.\n\nIn a perverse twist, black residents in many Northern cities had little recourse but to rent cramped, subdivided apartments in buildings whose white landlords often neglected repairs and upkeep, but the physical decay of their homes fed the white Americans\u2019 suspicions that black residents chose to live in squalor.\n\nIt was not just a matter of housing. A powerful combination of private-sector discrimination and nepotism within trade unions had long excluded black workers from well-paid, blue-collar industries. As George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO crassly admitted, \u201cWhen I was a plumber, it never [occurred] to me to have niggers in the union!\u201d Even in liberal bastions like New York City, African-Americans in the 1950s and 1960s composed less than 5 percent of all dock workers, skilled machinists, electricians or unionized carpenters\u2014the types of jobs that afforded non-college educated white men access to middle-class comfort and economic security in the post-war period. The black unemployment rate was double that of the city\u2019s overall unemployment rate. And New York was better than most places. In Chicago, 17 percent of black adults in the early 1960s were unemployed. In Cleveland, 20 percent. In Detroit, 39 percent.\n\nBy the time federal and state officials got serious about enforcing fair employment laws in the 1970s, America\u2019s manufacturing and extractive industries had already fallen into steady decline. In effect, two postwar forces most responsible for lifting millions of working-class families into middle-class comfort and privilege\u2014the suburban housing boom and unionized blue-collar jobs\u2014became available en masse to black Americans only as the post-war boom drew to a close.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a simple case of discrimination or inequality. Working-class white families affirmatively enjoyed what the historian George Lipsitz termed a \u201cpossessive investment in whiteness.\u201d They availed themselves of the G.I. Bill\u2019s housing and education benefits, paid for in part by black people\u2019s taxes, at a time when black veterans faced sharp limitations on where (or whether) they could draw the same benefits. They accumulated equity in their suburban homes and used it to send their children to college or to save for their retirement. They enjoyed access to public services\u2014from public schools and public trash collection, to clean water and sewage\u2014that were deficient in majority-minority neighborhoods. These advantages conferred second-order benefits, including better health and a higher average life expectancy.\n\nIn other words, whiteness did pay real wages. It delivered an intergenerational advantage to those who were in a position to claim it. And white working-class Americans seemed on some level to understand it. When, in 1966, Lyndon Johnson attempted to ram through Congress a law banning racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, white working-class voters revolted both in the streets and at the polls. (Ronald Reagan, a washed up former actor, unseated the otherwise popular incumbent governor of California, Pat Brown, largely by touting his opposition to the state\u2019s open housing law.) That summer, when Martin Luther King Jr. led protests throughout the \u201cbungalow belt\u201d in Chicago\u2019s working-class white neighborhoods and the nearby blue-collar suburb of Cicero, Polish, Italian and Irish residents who had once been staunch Democratic voters now erupted in fury. They pelted protesters with rocks and beat them with clubs amid cries of \u201cWhite Power!\u201d; \u201cBurn them like Jews\u201d; \u201cWe want Martin Luther Coon!\u201d; \u201cRoses are red, violets are black, King would look good with a knife in his back.\u201d\n\nJust a few years later, when the federal government began requiring that government contractors and industrial unions that did business with them begin making affirmative efforts to integrate their work forces, white voters gravitated to backlash politicians who promised to preserve their privilege in the job sector. Even as late as 1990, conservative Republican Senator Jesse Helms was able to make openly racist appeals on such grounds and pay no price. On the contrary, it was a winning formula.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe same dynamic that Du Bois grappled with is on display today. In breaking for Donald Trump and the GOP, working-class white voters are manifestly undercutting their economic self-interest. To be sure, Trump didn\u2019t campaign like an archetypal GOP plutocrat. He railed against free trade and immigration, policies that many white working-class citizens believe, with some justification, have hurt their communities. He promised to bring back manufacturing and coal mining jobs, eliminate generous tax loopholes for wealthy families like his own, and\u2014like Andrew Jackson, after whom he has patterned his presidency\u2014privilege the many over the few.\n\nBut Democrats and Never Trump Republicans shouted at the top of their lungs that Trump\u2019s campaign promises either weren\u2019t possible or that they wouldn\u2019t help working-class voters as much as he pledged. And they appear to have been right. The president recently signed into law a tax bill whose benefits, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office, accrue principally to corporations and super-rich individuals; many middle-class and working-class families will ultimately face a tax hike. The administration and its congressional supporters have also taken steps to make health care less affordable or altogether inaccessible, destabilize retirement security for working-class families, and allow industrial polluters to despoil the air they breathe and the water they drink. Despite what Trump said on the campaign trail, his agenda does little to help and much to hurt struggling white families.\n\nOf course, whiteness still delivers other dividends\u2014as it always has. It makes one less likely to be killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. It enables white men to carry assault weapons (including long guns) in places of public accommodation, while a black man might be shot and killed by law enforcement officials merely for picking up a BB gun displayed on a sales rack at Walmart. It affords working-class white families the peace of mind that the government won\u2019t invade homes or hospitals in pursuit of undocumented children or grandparents. Whiteness, in other words, continues to pay tangible benefits, and rightly or wrongly, it makes some sense that its primary beneficiaries are loath to support candidates who expressly promise to disrupt this privileged status.\n\nYet Trump has also, arguably more than any other candidate for president in the past hundred years (excepting third-party outliers like Strom Thurmond and George Wallace), played to the purely psychological benefits of being white. From his racially laden exhortations about black crime in Chicago and Latino gangs seemingly everywhere, to his attacks on an American-born federal judge of Mexican parentage and on Muslim gold star parents, he has paid the white majority with redemption and revanchism. Trump might be increasing economic inequality, but at least the working-class whites feel like they belong in Trump\u2019s America. He urged them to privilege race over class when they entered their polling stations.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t just stop there. As Ta-Nehisi Coates argues, Trump swept almost every white demographic group, forging a \u201cbroad white coalition that ran the gamut from Joe the Dishwasher to Joe the Plumber to Joe the Banker.\u201d It\u2019s not just blue-collar white people who seem blithely willing to sacrifice economic rationality for racial solidarity. After all, it arguably took a special kind of stupid for upper-middle class suburbanites in high-tax states to support a party that just raised their taxes. (No, this wasn\u2019t a bait-and-switch. The GOP leadership has talked openly about eliminating deductions for state and local taxes since 2014.) Unless, that is, you account for the wages of whiteness.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/31/trump-white-working-class-history-216200/"}, "article2": {"title": "The First White President", "content": "It is insufficient to state the obvious of Donald Trump: that he is a white man who would not be president were it not for this fact. With one immediate exception, Trump\u2019s predecessors made their way to high office through the passive power of whiteness\u2014that bloody heirloom which cannot ensure mastery of all events but can conjure a tailwind for most of them. Land theft and human plunder cleared the grounds for Trump\u2019s forefathers and barred others from it. Once upon the field, these men became soldiers, statesmen, and scholars; held court in Paris; presided at Princeton; advanced into the Wilderness and then into the White House.

But long before birtherism, Trump had made his worldview clear. He fought to keep blacks out of his buildings, according to the U.S. government; called for the death penalty for the eventually exonerated Central Park Five; and railed against \u201clazy\u201d black employees. \u201cBlack guys counting my money! I hate it,\u201d Trump was once quoted as saying. \u201cThe only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\u201d After his cabal of conspiracy theorists forced Barack Obama to present his birth certificate, Trump demanded the president\u2019s college grades (offering $5 million in exchange for them), insisting that Obama was not intelligent enough to have gone to an Ivy League school, and that his acclaimed memoir, Dreams From My Father, had been ghostwritten by a white man, Bill Ayers.\n\nExplore the October 2017 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nIt is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true\u2014his ideology is white supremacy, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power. Trump inaugurated his campaign by casting himself as the defender of white maidenhood against Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d only to be later alleged by multiple accusers, and by his own proud words, to be a sexual violator himself. White supremacy has always had a perverse sexual tint. Trump\u2019s rise was shepherded by Steve Bannon, a man who mocks his white male critics as \u201ccucks.\u201d The word, derived from cuckold, is specifically meant to debase by fear and fantasy\u2014the target is so weak that he would submit to the humiliation of having his white wife lie with black men. That the slur cuck casts white men as victims aligns with the dicta of whiteness, which seek to alchemize one\u2019s profligate sins into virtue. So it was with Virginia slaveholders claiming that Britain sought to make slaves of them. So it was with marauding Klansmen organized against alleged rapes and other outrages. So it was with a candidate who called for a foreign power to hack his opponent\u2019s email and who now, as president, is claiming to be the victim of \u201cthe single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.\u201d\n\nIn Trump, white supremacists see one of their own. Only grudgingly did Trump denounce the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, one of its former grand wizards\u2014and after the clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Duke in turn praised Trump\u2019s contentious claim that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible for the violence.\n\nTrump\u2019s political career began in advocacy of birtherism. But long before that, he had made his worldview clear.\n\nTo Trump, whiteness is neither notional nor symbolic but is the very core of his power. In this, Trump is not singular. But whereas his forebears carried whiteness like an ancestral talisman, Trump cracked the glowing amulet open, releasing its eldritch energies. The repercussions are striking: Trump is the first president to have served in no public capacity before ascending to his perch. But more telling, Trump is also the first president to have publicly affirmed that his daughter is a \u201cpiece of ass.\u201d The mind seizes trying to imagine a black man extolling the virtues of sexual assault on tape (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d), fending off multiple accusations of such assaults, immersed in multiple lawsuits for allegedly fraudulent business dealings, exhorting his followers to violence, and then strolling into the White House. But that is the point of white supremacy\u2014to ensure that that which all others achieve with maximal effort, white people (particularly white men) achieve with minimal qualification. Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that if they work twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump\u2019s counter is persuasive: Work half as hard as black people, and even more is possible.\n\nFor Trump, it almost seems that the fact of Obama, the fact of a black president, insulted him personally. The insult intensified when Obama and Seth Meyers publicly humiliated him at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2011. But the bloody heirloom ensures the last laugh. Replacing Obama is not enough\u2014Trump has made the negation of Obama\u2019s legacy the foundation of his own. And this too is whiteness. \u201cRace is an idea, not a fact,\u201d the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written, and essential to the construct of a \u201cwhite race\u201d is the idea of not being a nigger. Before Barack Obama, niggers could be manufactured out of Sister Souljahs, Willie Hortons, and Dusky Sallys. But Donald Trump arrived in the wake of something more potent\u2014an entire nigger presidency with nigger health care, nigger climate accords, and nigger justice reform, all of which could be targeted for destruction or redemption, thus reifying the idea of being white. Trump truly is something new\u2014the first president whose entire political existence hinges on the fact of a black president. And so it will not suffice to say that Trump is a white man like all the others who rose to become president. He must be called by his rightful honorific\u2014America\u2019s first white president.\n\nThe scope of Trump\u2019s commitment to whiteness is matched only by the depth of popular disbelief in the power of whiteness. We are now being told that support for Trump\u2019s \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d his scapegoating of immigrants, his defenses of police brutality are somehow the natural outgrowth of the cultural and economic gap between Lena Dunham\u2019s America and Jeff Foxworthy\u2019s. The collective verdict holds that the Democratic Party lost its way when it abandoned everyday economic issues like job creation for the softer fare of social justice. The indictment continues: To their neoliberal economics, Democrats and liberals have married a condescending elitist affect that sneers at blue-collar culture and mocks the white man as history\u2019s greatest monster and prime-time television\u2019s biggest doofus. In this rendition, Donald Trump is not the product of white supremacy so much as the product of a backlash against contempt for white working-class people.\n\n\u201cWe so obviously despise them, we so obviously condescend to them,\u201d the conservative social scientist Charles Murray, who co-wrote The Bell Curve, recently told The New Yorker, speaking of the white working class. \u201cThe only slur you can use at a dinner party and get away with is to call somebody a redneck\u2014that won\u2019t give you any problems in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nWhite Americans elected an orcish reality-TV star who insists on taking his intelligence briefings in picture-book form.\n\n\u201cThe utter contempt with which privileged Eastern liberals such as myself discuss red-state, gun-country, working-class America as ridiculous and morons and rubes,\u201d charged the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, \u201cis largely responsible for the upswell of rage and contempt and desire to pull down the temple that we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d\n\nThat black people, who have lived for centuries under such derision and condescension, have not yet been driven into the arms of Trump does not trouble these theoreticians. After all, in this analysis, Trump\u2019s racism and the racism of his supporters are incidental to his rise. Indeed, the alleged glee with which liberals call out Trump\u2019s bigotry is assigned even more power than the bigotry itself. Ostensibly assaulted by campus protests, battered by arguments about intersectionality, and oppressed by new bathroom rights, a blameless white working class did the only thing any reasonable polity might: elect an orcish reality-television star who insists on taking his intelligence briefings in picture-book form.\n\nThe Republican National Convention, Cleveland, July 2016. According to preelection polling, if you tallied only white voters, Trump would have defeated Clinton 389 to 81 in the Electoral College. (Gabriella Demczuk)\n\nAsserting that Trump\u2019s rise was primarily powered by cultural resentment and economic reversal has become de rigueur among white pundits and thought leaders. But evidence for this is, at best, mixed. In a study of preelection polling data, the Gallup researchers Jonathan Rothwell and Pablo Diego-Rosell found that \u201cpeople living in areas with diminished economic opportunity\u201d were \u201csomewhat more likely to support Trump.\u201d But the researchers also found that voters in their study who supported Trump generally had a higher mean household income ($81,898) than those who did not ($77,046). Those who approved of Trump were \u201cless likely to be unemployed and less likely to be employed part-time\u201d than those who did not. They also tended to be from areas that were very white: \u201cThe racial and ethnic isolation of whites at the zip code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of exit polls conducted during the presidential primaries estimated the median household income of Trump supporters to be about $72,000. But even this lower number is almost double the median household income of African Americans, and $15,000 above the American median. Trump\u2019s white support was not determined by income. According to Edison Research, Trump won whites making less than $50,000 by 20 points, whites making $50,000 to $99,999 by 28 points, and whites making $100,000 or more by 14 points. This shows that Trump assembled a broad white coalition that ran the gamut from Joe the Dishwasher to Joe the Plumber to Joe the Banker. So when white pundits cast the elevation of Trump as the handiwork of an inscrutable white working class, they are being too modest, declining to claim credit for their own economic class. Trump\u2019s dominance among whites across class lines is of a piece with his larger dominance across nearly every white demographic. Trump won white women (+9) and white men (+31). He won white people with college degrees (+3) and white people without them (+37). He won whites ages 18\u201329 (+4), 30\u201344 (+17), 45\u201364 (+28), and 65 and older (+19). Trump won whites in midwestern Illinois (+11), whites in mid-Atlantic New Jersey (+12), and whites in the Sun Belt\u2019s New Mexico (+5). In no state that Edison polled did Trump\u2019s white support dip below 40 percent. Hillary Clinton\u2019s did, in states as disparate as Florida, Utah, Indiana, and Kentucky. From the beer track to the wine track, from soccer moms to nascar dads, Trump\u2019s performance among whites was dominant. According to Mother Jones, based on preelection polling data, if you tallied the popular vote of only white America to derive 2016 electoral votes, Trump would have defeated Clinton 389 to 81, with the remaining 68 votes either a toss-up or unknown.\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s dominance among whites resulted from his running as a Republican, the party that has long cultivated white voters. Trump\u2019s share of the white vote was similar to Mitt Romney\u2019s in 2012. But unlike Romney, Trump secured this support by running against his party\u2019s leadership, against accepted campaign orthodoxy, and against all notions of decency. By his sixth month in office, embroiled in scandal after scandal, a Pew Research Center poll found Trump\u2019s approval rating underwater with every single demographic group. Every demographic group, that is, except one: people who identified as white.\n\nVideo: \u201cIt\u2019s Impossible to Imagine Trump Without the Force of Whiteness\u201d\n\nThe focus on one subsector of Trump voters\u2014the white working class\u2014is puzzling, given the breadth of his white coalition. Indeed, there is a kind of theater at work in which Trump\u2019s presidency is pawned off as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning. The motive is clear: escapism. To accept that the bloody heirloom remains potent even now, some five decades after Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down on a Memphis balcony\u2014even after a black president; indeed, strengthened by the fact of that black president\u2014is to accept that racism remains, as it has since 1776, at the heart of this country\u2019s political life. The idea of acceptance frustrates the left. The left would much rather have a discussion about class struggles, which might entice the white working masses, instead of about the racist struggles that those same masses have historically been the agents and beneficiaries of. Moreover, to accept that whiteness brought us Donald Trump is to accept whiteness as an existential danger to the country and the world. But if the broad and remarkable white support for Donald Trump can be reduced to the righteous anger of a noble class of smallville firefighters and evangelicals, mocked by Brooklyn hipsters and womanist professors into voting against their interests, then the threat of racism and whiteness, the threat of the heirloom, can be dismissed. Consciences can be eased; no deeper existential reckoning is required.\n\nAn opioid epidemic is greeted with calls for compassion and treatment; a crack epidemic is greeted with scorn and mandatory minimums.\n\nThis transfiguration is not novel. It is a return to form. The tightly intertwined stories of the white working class and black Americans go back to the prehistory of the United States\u2014and the use of one as a cudgel to silence the claims of the other goes back nearly as far. Like the black working class, the white working class originated in bondage\u2014the former in the lifelong bondage of slavery, the latter in the temporary bondage of indenture. In the early 17th century, these two classes were remarkably, though not totally, free of racist enmity. But by the 18th century, the country\u2019s master class had begun etching race into law while phasing out indentured servitude in favor of a more enduring labor solution. From these and other changes of law and economy, a bargain emerged: The descendants of indenture would enjoy the full benefits of whiteness, the most definitional benefit being that they would never sink to the level of the slave. But if the bargain protected white workers from slavery, it did not protect them from near-slave wages or backbreaking labor to attain them, and always there lurked a fear of having their benefits revoked. This early white working class \u201cexpressed soaring desires to be rid of the age-old inequalities of Europe and of any hint of slavery,\u201d according to David R. Roediger, a professor of American studies at the University of Kansas. \u201cThey also expressed the rather more pedestrian goal of simply not being mistaken for slaves, or \u2018negers\u2019 or \u2018negurs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRoediger relates the experience, around 1807, of a British investor who made the mistake of asking a white maid in New England whether her \u201cmaster\u201d was home. The maid admonished the investor, not merely for implying that she had a \u201cmaster\u201d and thus was a \u201csarvant\u201d but for his basic ignorance of American hierarchy. \u201cNone but negers are sarvants,\u201d the maid is reported to have said. In law and economics and then in custom, a racist distinction not limited to the household emerged between the \u201chelp\u201d (or the \u201cfreemen,\u201d or the white workers) and the \u201cservants\u201d (the \u201cnegers,\u201d the slaves). The former were virtuous and just, worthy of citizenship, progeny of Jefferson and, later, Jackson. The latter were servile and parasitic, dim-witted and lazy, the children of African savagery. But the dignity accorded to white labor was situational, dependent on the scorn heaped upon black labor\u2014much as the honor accorded a \u201cvirtuous lady\u201d was dependent on the derision directed at a \u201cloose woman.\u201d And like chivalrous gentlemen who claim to honor the lady while raping the \u201cwhore,\u201d planters and their apologists could claim to honor white labor while driving the enslaved.\n\nAnd so George Fitzhugh, a prominent 19th-century Southern pro-slavery intellectual, could in a single stroke deplore the exploitation of free whites\u2019 labor while defending the exploitation of enslaved blacks\u2019 labor. Fitzhugh attacked white capitalists as \u201ccannibals,\u201d feeding off the labor of their fellow whites. The white workers were \u201c \u2018slaves without masters;\u2019 the little fish, who were food for all the larger.\u201d Fitzhugh inveighed against a \u201cprofessional man\u201d who\u2019d \u201camassed a fortune\u201d by exploiting his fellow whites. But whereas Fitzhugh imagined white workers as devoured by capital, he imagined black workers as elevated by enslavement. The slaveholder \u201cprovided for them, with almost parental affection\u201d\u2014even when the loafing slave \u201cfeigned to be unfit for labor.\u201d Fitzhugh proved too explicit\u2014going so far as to argue that white laborers might be better off if enslaved. (\u201cIf white slavery be morally wrong,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe Bible cannot be true.\u201d) Nevertheless, the argument that America\u2019s original sin was not deep-seated white supremacy but rather the exploitation of white labor by white capitalists\u2014\u201cwhite slavery\u201d\u2014proved durable. Indeed, the panic of white slavery lives on in our politics today. Black workers suffer because it was and is our lot. But when white workers suffer, something in nature has gone awry. And so an opioid epidemic among mostly white people is greeted with calls for compassion and treatment, as all epidemics should be, while a crack epidemic among mostly black people is greeted with scorn and mandatory minimums. Sympathetic op\u2011ed columns and articles are devoted to the plight of working-class whites when their life expectancy plummets to levels that, for blacks, society has simply accepted as normal. White slavery is sin. Nigger slavery is natural. This dynamic serves a very real purpose: the consistent awarding of grievance and moral high ground to that class of workers which, by the bonds of whiteness, stands closest to America\u2019s aristocratic class.\n\nThis is by design. Speaking in 1848, Senator John C. Calhoun saw slavery as the explicit foundation for a democratic union among whites, working and not:\n\nWith us the two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black; and all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.\n\nOn the eve of secession, Jefferson Davis, the eventual president of the Confederacy, pushed the idea further, arguing that such equality between the white working class and white oligarchs could not exist at all without black slavery:\n\nI say that the lower race of human beings that constitute the substratum of what is termed the slave population of the South, elevates every white man in our community \u2026 It is the presence of a lower caste, those lower by their mental and physical organization, controlled by the higher intellect of the white man, that gives this superiority to the white laborer. Menial services are not there performed by the white man. We have none of our brethren sunk to the degradation of being menials. That belongs to the lower race\u2014the descendants of Ham.\n\nSouthern intellectuals found a shade of agreement with Northern white reformers who, while not agreeing on slavery, agreed on the nature of the most tragic victim of emerging capitalism. \u201cI was formerly like yourself, sir, a very warm advocate of the abolition of slavery,\u201d the labor reformer George Henry Evans argued in a letter to the abolitionist Gerrit Smith. \u201cThis was before I saw that there was white slavery.\u201d Evans was a putative ally of Smith and his fellow abolitionists. But still he asserted that \u201cthe landless white\u201d was worse off than the enslaved black, who at least enjoyed \u201csurety of support in sickness and old age.\u201d\n\nInvokers of \u201cwhite slavery\u201d held that there was nothing unique in the enslavement of blacks when measured against the enslavement of all workers. What evil there was in enslavement resulted from its status as a subsidiary of the broader exploitation better seen among the country\u2019s noble laboring whites. Once the larger problem of white exploitation was solved, the dependent problem of black exploitation could be confronted or perhaps would fade away. Abolitionists focused on slavery were dismissed as \u201csubstitutionists\u201d who wished to trade one form of slavery for another. \u201cIf I am less troubled concerning the Slavery prevalent in Charleston or New-Orleans,\u201d wrote the reformer Horace Greeley, \u201cit is because I see so much Slavery in New-York, which appears to claim my first efforts.\u201d\n\nFirsthand reports by white Union soldiers who witnessed actual slavery during the Civil War rendered the \u201cwhite slavery\u201d argument ridiculous. But its operating premises\u2014white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else\u2014lived on. This was a matter of rhetoric, not fact. The noble-white-labor archetype did not give white workers immunity from capitalism. It could not, in itself, break monopolies, alleviate white poverty in Appalachia or the South, or bring a decent wage to immigrant ghettos in the North. But the model for America\u2019s original identity politics was set. Black lives literally did not matter and could be cast aside altogether as the price of even incremental gains for the white masses. It was this juxtaposition that allowed Theodore Bilbo to campaign for the Senate in the 1930s as someone who would \u201craise the same kind of hell as President Roosevelt\u201d and later endorse lynching black people to keep them from voting.\n\nThe juxtaposition between the valid and even virtuous interests of the \u201cworking class\u201d and the invalid and pathological interests of black Americans was not the province merely of blatant white supremacists like Bilbo. The acclaimed scholar, liberal hero, and future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in his time working for President Richard Nixon, approvingly quoted Nixon\u2019s formulation of the white working class: \u201cA new voice\u201d was beginning to make itself felt in the country. \u201cIt is a voice that has been silent too long,\u201d Nixon claimed, alluding to working-class whites. \u201cIt is a voice of people who have not taken to the streets before, who have not indulged in violence, who have not broken the law.\u201d\n\nThe fact of a black president seemed to insult Donald Trump personally. He has made the negation of Barack Obama\u2019s legacy the foundation of his own. (Gabriella Demczuk)\n\nIt had been only 18 years since the Cicero riots; eight years since Daisy and Bill Myers had been run out of Levittown, Pennsylvania; three years since Martin Luther King Jr. had been stoned while walking through Chicago\u2019s Marquette Park. But as the myth of the virtuous white working class was made central to American identity, its sins needed to be rendered invisible. The fact was, working-class whites had been agents of racist terrorism since at least the draft riots of 1863; terrorism could not be neatly separated from the racist animus found in every class of whites. Indeed, in the era of lynching, the daily newspapers often whipped up the fury of the white masses by invoking the last species of property that all white men held in common\u2014white women. But to conceal the breadth of white racism, these racist outbursts were often disregarded or treated not as racism but as the unfortunate side effect of legitimate grievances against capital. By focusing on that sympathetic laboring class, the sins of whiteness itself were, and are still being, evaded.\n\nWhen David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, shocked the country in 1990 by almost winning one of Louisiana\u2019s seats in the U.S. Senate, the apologists came out once again. They elided the obvious\u2014that Duke had appealed to the racist instincts of a state whose schools are, at this very moment, still desegregating\u2014and instead decided that something else was afoot. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of anger and frustration among working-class whites, particularly where there is an economic downturn,\u201d a researcher told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThese people feel left out; they feel government is not responsive to them.\u201d By this logic, postwar America\u2014with its booming economy and low unemployment\u2014should have been an egalitarian utopia and not the violently segregated country it actually was.\n\nBut this was the past made present. It was not important to the apologists that a large swath of Louisiana\u2019s white population thought it was a good idea to send a white supremacist who once fronted a terrorist organization to the nation\u2019s capital. Nor was it important that blacks in Louisiana had long felt left out. What was important was the fraying of an ancient bargain, and the potential degradation of white workers to the level of \u201cnegers.\u201d \u201cA viable left must find a way to differentiate itself strongly from such analysis,\u201d David Roediger, the University of Kansas professor, has written.\n\nThat challenge of differentiation has largely been ignored. Instead, an imagined white working class remains central to our politics and to our cultural understanding of those politics, not simply when it comes to addressing broad economic issues but also when it comes to addressing racism. At its most sympathetic, this belief holds that most Americans\u2014regardless of race\u2014are exploited by an unfettered capitalist economy. The key, then, is to address those broader patterns that afflict the masses of all races; the people who suffer from those patterns more than others (blacks, for instance) will benefit disproportionately from that which benefits everyone. \u201cThese days, what ails working-class and middle-class blacks and Latinos is not fundamentally different from what ails their white counterparts,\u201d Senator Barack Obama wrote in 2006:\n\nDownsizing, outsourcing, automation, wage stagnation, the dismantling of employer-based health-care and pension plans, and schools that fail to teach young people the skills they need to compete in a global economy.\n\nObama allowed that \u201cblacks in particular have been vulnerable to these trends\u201d\u2014but less because of racism than for reasons of geography and job-sector distribution. This notion\u2014raceless antiracism\u2014marks the modern left, from the New Democrat Bill Clinton to the socialist Bernie Sanders. Few national liberal politicians have shown any recognition that there is something systemic and particular in the relationship between black people and their country that might require specific policy solutions.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton acknowledged the existence of systemic racism more explicitly than any of her modern Democratic predecessors. She had to\u2014black voters remembered too well the previous Clinton administration, as well as her previous campaign. While her husband\u2019s administration had touted the rising-tide theory of economic growth, it did so while slashing welfare and getting \u201ctough on crime,\u201d a phrase that stood for specific policies but also served as rhetorical bait for white voters. One is tempted to excuse Hillary Clinton from having to answer for the sins of her husband. But in her 2008 campaign, she evoked the old dichotomy between white workers and loafing blacks, claiming to be the representative of \u201chardworking Americans, white Americans.\u201d By the end of the 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama, her advisers were hoping someone would uncover an apocryphal \u201cwhitey tape,\u201d in which an angry Michelle Obama was alleged to have used the slur. During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential-reelection campaign in the mid-1990s, Hillary Clinton herself had endorsed the \u201csuper-predator\u201d theory of William J. Bennett, John P. Walters, and John J. DiIulio Jr. This theory cast \u201cinner-city\u201d children of that era as \u201calmost completely unmoralized\u201d and the font of \u201ca new generation of street criminals \u2026 the youngest, biggest and baddest generation any society has ever known.\u201d The \u201cbaddest generation\u201d did not become super-predators. But by 2016, they were young adults, many of whom judged Hillary Clinton\u2019s newfound consciousness to be lacking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking why the country has not been treated to a raft of sympathetic portraits of this \u201cforgotten\u201d young black electorate, forsaken by a Washington bought off by Davos elites and special interests. The unemployment rate for young blacks (20.6 percent) in July 2016 was double that of young whites (9.9 percent). And since the late 1970s, William Julius Wilson and other social scientists following in his wake have noted the disproportionate effect that the decline in manufacturing jobs has had on African American communities. If anyone should be angered by the devastation wreaked by the financial sector and a government that declined to prosecute the perpetrators, it is African Americans\u2014the housing crisis was one of the primary drivers in the past 20 years of the wealth gap between black families and the rest of the country. But the cultural condescension toward and economic anxiety of black people is not news. Toiling blacks are in their proper state; toiling whites raise the specter of white slavery.\n\nMoreover, a narrative of long-neglected working-class black voters, injured by globalization and the financial crisis, forsaken by out-of-touch politicians, and rightfully suspicious of a return of Clintonism, does not serve to cleanse the conscience of white people for having elected Donald Trump. Only the idea of a long-suffering white working class can do that. And though much has been written about the distance between elites and \u201cReal America,\u201d the existence of a class-transcending, mutually dependent tribe of white people is evident.\n\nJoe Biden, then the vice president, last year:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all the people I grew up with \u2026 And they\u2019re not racist. They\u2019re not sexist.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders, senator and former candidate for president, last year:\n\n\u201cI come from the white working class, and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to the people where I came from.\u201d\n\nNicholas Kristof, the New York Times columnist, in February of this year:\n\nMy hometown, Yamhill, Ore., a farming community, is Trump country, and I have many friends who voted for Trump. I think they\u2019re profoundly wrong, but please don\u2019t dismiss them as hateful bigots.\n\nThese claims of origin and fidelity are not merely elite defenses of an aggrieved class but also a sweeping dismissal of the concerns of those who don\u2019t share kinship with white men. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat equality,\u201d asserts Joe Biden\u2014a statement worthy of someone unthreatened by the loss of wages brought on by an unwanted pregnancy, a background-check box at the bottom of a job application, or the deportation of a breadwinner. Within a week of Sanders lambasting Democrats for not speaking to \u201cthe people\u201d where he \u201ccame from,\u201d he was making an example of a woman who dreamed of representing the people where she came from. Confronted with a young woman who hoped to become the second Latina senator in American history, Sanders responded with a parody of the Clinton campaign: \u201cIt is not good enough for someone to say, \u2018I\u2019m a woman! Vote for me!\u2019 No, that\u2019s not good enough \u2026 One of the struggles that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.\u201d The upshot\u2014attacking one specimen of identity politics after having invoked another\u2014was unfortunate.\n\nThe KKK and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, July 8, 2017. Not every Trump voter is a white supremacist. But every Trump voter felt it acceptable to hand the fate of the country over to one. (Gabriella Demczuk)\n\nOther Sanders appearances proved even more alarming. On MSNBC, he attributed Trump\u2019s success, in part, to his willingness to \u201cnot be politically correct.\u201d Sanders admitted that Trump had \u201csaid some outrageous and painful things, but I think people are tired of the same old, same old political rhetoric.\u201d Pressed on the definition of political correctness, Sanders gave an answer Trump surely would have approved of. \u201cWhat it means is you have a set of talking points which have been poll-tested and focus-group-tested,\u201d Sanders explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you say rather than what\u2019s really going on. And often, what you are not allowed to say are things which offend very, very powerful people.\u201d\n\nThis definition of political correctness was shocking coming from a politician of the left. But it matched a broader defense of Trump voters. \u201cSome people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and just deplorable folks,\u201d Sanders said later. \u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d This is not exculpatory. Certainly not every Trump voter is a white supremacist, just as not every white person in the Jim Crow South was a white supremacist. But every Trump voter felt it acceptable to hand the fate of the country over to one.\n\nOne can, to some extent, understand politicians\u2019 embracing a self-serving identity politics. Candidates for high office, such as Sanders, have to cobble together a coalition. The white working class is seen, understandably, as a large cache of potential votes, and capturing these votes requires eliding uncomfortable truths. But journalists have no such excuse. Again and again in the past year, Nicholas Kristof could be found pleading with his fellow liberals not to dismiss his old comrades in the white working class as bigots\u2014even when their bigotry was evidenced in his own reporting. A visit to Tulsa, Oklahoma, finds Kristof wondering why Trump voters support a president who threatens to cut the programs they depend on. But the problem, according to Kristof \u2019s interviewees, isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s attack on benefits so much as an attack on their benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wasteful spending, so cut other places,\u201d one man tells Kristof. When Kristof pushes his subjects to identify that wasteful spending, a fascinating target is revealed: \u201cObama phones,\u201d the products of a fevered conspiracy theory that turned a long-standing government program into a scheme through which the then-president gave away free cellphones to undeserving blacks. Kristof doesn\u2019t shift his analysis based on this comment and, aside from a one-sentence fact-check tucked between parentheses, continues on as though it were never said.\n\nObserving a Trump supporter in the act of deploying racism does not much perturb Kristof. That is because his defenses of the innate goodness of Trump voters and of the innate goodness of the white working class are in fact defenses of neither. On the contrary, the white working class functions rhetorically not as a real community of people so much as a tool to quiet the demands of those who want a more inclusive America.\n\nMark Lilla\u2019s New York Times essay \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism,\u201d published not long after last year\u2019s election, is perhaps the most profound example of this genre. Lilla denounces the perversion of liberalism into \u201ca kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity,\u201d which distorted liberalism\u2019s message \u201cand prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\u201d Liberals have turned away from their working-class base, he says, and must look to the \u201cpre-identity liberalism\u201d of Bill Clinton and Franklin D. Roosevelt. You would never know from this essay that Bill Clinton was one of the most skillful identity politicians of his era\u2014flying home to Arkansas to see a black man, the lobotomized Ricky Ray Rector, executed; upstaging Jesse Jackson at his own conference; signing the Defense of Marriage Act. Nor would you know that the \u201cpre-identity\u201d liberal champion Roosevelt depended on the literally lethal identity politics of the white-supremacist \u201csolid South.\u201d The name Barack Obama does not appear in Lilla\u2019s essay, and he never attempts to grapple, one way or another, with the fact that it was identity politics\u2014the possibility of the first black president\u2014that brought a record number of black voters to the polls, winning the election for the Democratic Party, and thus enabling the deliverance of the ancient liberal goal of national health care. \u201cIdentity politics \u2026 is largely expressive, not persuasive,\u201d Lilla claims. \u201cWhich is why it never wins elections\u2014but can lose them.\u201d That Trump ran and won on identity politics is beyond Lilla\u2019s powers of conception. What appeals to the white working class is ennobled. What appeals to black workers, and all others outside the tribe, is dastardly identitarianism. All politics are identity politics\u2014except the politics of white people, the politics of the bloody heirloom.\n\nWhite tribalism haunts even more-nuanced writers. George Packer\u2019s New Yorker essay \u201cThe Unconnected\u201d is a lengthy plea for liberals to focus more on the white working class, a population that \u201chas succumbed to the ills that used to be associated with the black urban \u2018underclass.\u2019 \u201d Packer believes that these ills, and the Democratic Party\u2019s failure to respond to them, explain much of Trump\u2019s rise. Packer offers no opinion polls to weigh white workers\u2019 views on \u201celites,\u201d much less their views on racism. He offers no sense of how their views and their relationship to Trump differ from other workers\u2019 and other whites\u2019.\n\nThat is likely because any empirical evaluation of the relationship between Trump and the white working class would reveal that one adjective in that phrase is doing more work than the other. In 2016, Trump enjoyed majority or plurality support among every economic branch of whites. It is true that his strongest support among whites came from those making $50,000 to $99,999. This would be something more than working-class in many nonwhite neighborhoods, but even if one accepts that branch as the working class, the difference between how various groups in this income bracket voted is revealing. Sixty-one percent of whites in this \u201cworking class\u201d supported Trump. Only 24 percent of Hispanics and 11 percent of blacks did. Indeed, the plurality of all voters making less than $100,000 and the majority making less than $50,000 voted for the Democratic candidate. So when Packer laments the fact that \u201cDemocrats can no longer really claim to be the party of working people\u2014not white ones, anyway,\u201d he commits a kind of category error. The real problem is that Democrats aren\u2019t the party of white people\u2014working or otherwise. White workers are not divided by the fact of labor from other white demographics; they are divided from all other laborers by the fact of their whiteness.\n\nPacker\u2019s essay was published before the election, and so the vote tally was not available. But it should not be surprising that a Republican candidate making a direct appeal to racism would drive up the numbers among white voters, given that racism has been a dividing line for the national parties since the civil-rights era. Packer finds inspiration for his thesis in West Virginia\u2014a state that remained Democratic through the 1990s before turning decisively Republican, at least at the level of presidential politics. This relatively recent rightward movement evinces, to Packer, a shift \u201cthat couldn\u2019t be attributed just to the politics of race.\u201d This is likely true\u2014the politics of race are, themselves, never attributable \u201cjust to the politics of race.\u201d The history of slavery is also about the growth of international capitalism; the history of lynching must be seen in light of anxiety over the growing independence of women; the civil-rights movement can\u2019t be disentangled from the Cold War. Thus, to say that the rise of Donald Trump is about more than race is to make an empty statement, one that is small comfort to the people\u2014black, Muslim, immigrant\u2014who live under racism\u2019s boot.\n\nThe dent of racism is not hard to detect in West Virginia. In the 2008 Democratic primary there, 95 percent of the voters were white. Twenty percent of those\u2014one in five\u2014openly admitted that race was influencing their vote, and more than 80 percent voted for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama. Four years later, the incumbent Obama lost the primary in 10 counties to Keith Judd, a white felon incarcerated in a federal prison; Judd racked up more than 40 percent of the Democratic-primary vote in the state. A simple thought experiment: Can one imagine a black felon in a federal prison running in a primary against an incumbent white president doing so well?\n\nBut racism occupies a mostly passive place in Packer\u2019s essay. There\u2019s no attempt to understand why black and brown workers, victimized by the same new economy and cosmopolitan elite that Packer lambastes, did not join the Trump revolution. Like Kristof, Packer is gentle with his subjects. When a woman \u201cexploded\u201d and told Packer, \u201cI want to eat what I want to eat, and for them to tell me I can\u2019t eat French fries or Coca-Cola\u2014no way,\u201d he sees this as a rebellion against \u201cthe moral superiority of elites.\u201d In fact, this elite conspiracy dates back to 1894, when the government first began advising Americans on their diets. As recently as 2002, President George W. Bush launched the HealthierUS initiative, urging Americans to exercise and eat healthy food. But Packer never allows himself to wonder whether the explosion he witnessed had anything to do with the fact that similar advice now came from the country\u2019s first black first lady. Packer concludes that Obama was leaving the country \u201cmore divided and angrier than most Americans can remember,\u201d a statement that is likely true only because most Americans identify as white. Certainly the men and women forced to live in the wake of the beating of John Lewis, the lynching of Emmett Till, the firebombing of Percy Julian\u2019s home, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers would disagree.\n\nTrump\u2019s legacy will be exposing the patina of decency for what it is and revealing just how much a demagogue can get away with.\n\nThe triumph of Trump\u2019s campaign of bigotry presented the problematic spectacle of an American president succeeding at best in spite of his racism and possibly because of it. Trump moved racism from the euphemistic and plausibly deniable to the overt and freely claimed. This presented the country\u2019s thinking class with a dilemma. Hillary Clinton simply could not be correct when she asserted that a large group of Americans was endorsing a candidate because of bigotry. The implications\u2014that systemic bigotry is still central to our politics; that the country is susceptible to such bigotry; that the salt-of-the-earth Americans whom we lionize in our culture and politics are not so different from those same Americans who grin back at us in lynching photos; that Calhoun\u2019s aim of a pan-Caucasian embrace between workers and capitalists still endures\u2014were just too dark. Leftists would have to cope with the failure, yet again, of class unity in the face of racism. Incorporating all of this into an analysis of America and the path forward proved too much to ask. Instead, the response has largely been an argument aimed at emotion\u2014the summoning of the white working class, emblem of America\u2019s hardscrabble roots, inheritor of its pioneer spirit, as a shield against the horrific and empirical evidence of trenchant bigotry.\n\nPacker dismisses the Democratic Party as a coalition of \u201crising professionals and diversity.\u201d The dismissal is derived from, of all people, Lawrence Summers, the former Harvard president and White House economist, who last year labeled the Democratic Party \u201ca coalition of the cosmopolitan \u00e9lite and diversity.\u201d The inference is that the party has forgotten how to speak on hard economic issues and prefers discussing presumably softer cultural issues such as \u201cdiversity.\u201d It\u2019s worth unpacking what, precisely, falls under this rubric of \u201cdiversity\u201d\u2014resistance to the monstrous incarceration of legions of black men, resistance to the destruction of health providers for poor women, resistance to the effort to deport parents, resistance to a policing whose sole legitimacy is rooted in brute force, resistance to a theory of education that preaches \u201cno excuses\u201d to black and brown children, even as excuses are proffered for mendacious corporate executives \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d That this suite of concerns, taken together, can be dismissed by both an elite economist like Summers and a brilliant journalist like Packer as \u201cdiversity\u201d simply reveals the safe space they enjoy. Because of their identity.\n\nWhen Barack Obama came into office, in 2009, he believed that he could work with \u201csensible\u201d conservatives by embracing aspects of their policy as his own. Instead he found that his very imprimatur made that impossible. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the GOP\u2019s primary goal was not to find common ground but to make Obama a \u201cone-term president.\u201d A health-care plan inspired by Romneycare was, when proposed by Obama, suddenly considered socialist and, not coincidentally, a form of reparations. The first black president found that he was personally toxic to the GOP base. An entire political party was organized around the explicit aim of negating one man. It was thought by Obama and some of his allies that this toxicity was the result of a relentless assault waged by Fox News and right-wing talk radio. Trump\u2019s genius was to see that it was something more, that it was a hunger for revanche so strong that a political novice and accused rapist could topple the leadership of one major party and throttle the heavily favored nominee of the other.\n\n\u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters,\u201d Trump bragged in January 2016. This statement should be met with only a modicum of skepticism. Trump has mocked the disabled, withstood multiple accusations of sexual violence (all of which he has denied), fired an FBI director, sent his minions to mislead the public about his motives, personally exposed those lies by boldly stating his aim to scuttle an investigation into his possible collusion with a foreign power, then bragged about that same obstruction to representatives of that same foreign power. It is utterly impossible to conjure a black facsimile of Donald Trump\u2014to imagine Obama, say, implicating an opponent\u2019s father in the assassination of an American president or comparing his physical endowment with that of another candidate and then successfully capturing the presidency. Trump, more than any other politician, understood the valence of the bloody heirloom and the great power in not being a nigger.\n\nJanuary 6, 2017. Republicans applaud after Congress certifies Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the Electoral College. The American tragedy now being wrought will not end with him. (Gabriella Demczuk)\n\nBut the power is ultimately suicidal. Trump evinces this, too. In a recent New Yorker article, a former Russian military officer pointed out that interference in an election could succeed only where \u201cnecessary conditions\u201d and an \u201cexisting background\u201d were present. In America, that \u201cexisting background\u201d was a persistent racism, and the \u201cnecessary condition\u201d was a black president. The two related factors hobbled America\u2019s ability to safeguard its electoral system. As late as July 2016, a majority of Republican voters doubted that Barack Obama had been born in the United States, which is to say they did not view him as a legitimate president. Republican politicians acted accordingly, infamously denying his final Supreme Court nominee a hearing and then, fatefully, refusing to work with the administration to defend the country against the Russian attack. Before the election, Obama found no takers among Republicans for a bipartisan response, and Obama himself, underestimating Trump and thus underestimating the power of whiteness, believed the Republican nominee too objectionable to actually win. In this Obama was, tragically, wrong. And so the most powerful country in the world has handed over all its affairs\u2014the prosperity of its entire economy; the security of its 300 million citizens; the purity of its water, the viability of its air, the safety of its food; the future of its vast system of education; the soundness of its national highways, airways, and railways; the apocalyptic potential of its nuclear arsenal\u2014to a carnival barker who introduced the phrase grab \u2019em by the pussy into the national lexicon. It is as if the white tribe united in demonstration to say, \u201cIf a black man can be president, then any white man\u2014no matter how fallen\u2014can be president.\u201d And in that perverse way, the democratic dreams of Jefferson and Jackson were fulfilled.\n\nThe American tragedy now being wrought is larger than most imagine and will not end with Trump. In recent times, whiteness as an overt political tactic has been restrained by a kind of cordiality that held that its overt invocation would scare off \u201cmoderate\u201d whites. This has proved to be only half true at best. Trump\u2019s legacy will be exposing the patina of decency for what it is and revealing just how much a demagogue can get away with. It does not take much to imagine another politician, wiser in the ways of Washington and better schooled in the methodology of governance\u2014and now liberated from the pretense of antiracist civility\u2014doing a much more effective job than Trump.\n\nIt has long been an axiom among certain black writers and thinkers that while whiteness endangers the bodies of black people in the immediate sense, the larger threat is to white people themselves, the shared country, and even the whole world. There is an impulse to blanch at this sort of grandiosity. When W. E. B. Du Bois claims that slavery was \u201csingularly disastrous for modern civilization\u201d or James Baldwin claims that whites \u201chave brought humanity to the edge of oblivion: because they think they are white,\u201d the instinct is to cry exaggeration. But there really is no other way to read the presidency of Donald Trump. The first white president in American history is also the most dangerous president\u2014and he is made more dangerous still by the fact that those charged with analyzing him cannot name his essential nature, because they too are implicated in it.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/"}, "article3": {"title": "How Trump won: The revenge of working-class whites", "content": "Gift Article Share\n\nFor the past 40 years, America's economy has raked blue-collar white men over the coals. It whittled their paychecks. It devalued the type of work they did best. It shuttered factories and mines and shops in their communities. New industries sprouted in cities where they didn't live, powered by workers with college degrees they didn't hold.\n\nThey were not the only ones who felt abandoned by a rapidly globalizing economy, but they developed a distinctly strong pessimism in its face.\n\nOn Tuesday, their frustrations helped elect Donald Trump, the first major-party nominee of the modern era to speak directly and relentlessly to their economic and cultural fears. It was a \u201cBrexit\u201d moment in America, a revolt of working-class whites who felt stung by globalization and uneasy in a diversifying country where their political power had seemed to be diminishing.\n\nEarly on the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIt was a rejection of the business-friendly policies favored at various points by elites in both parties, which deepened trade relationships with foreign countries and favored allowing more immigrants in. And it was a raw outburst at the trends of rising inequality and economic dislocation that defined America's economy thus far this century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhites without a college degree \u2014 men and women \u2014 made up a third of the 2016 electorate. Trump won them by 39 percentage points, according to exit polls, far surpassing 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's 25 percent margin. They were the foundation of his victories across the Rust Belt, including a blowout win in Ohio and stunning upsets in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nIn polling, these voters have expressed deep racial and cultural anxieties. In exit polls they were more likely than the country as a whole to say that illegal immigrants should be deported. But those polls also suggested economic concerns and hostility toward leaders in Washington were much more important factors driving them to Trump.\n\nHalf of these voters said the economy was the most important issue in their vote, compared to 14 percent for immigration. A majority said international trade takes away American jobs. Three-quarters said the economy is \u201cnot good\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d and nearly 8 in 10 said their personal financial situation was the same or worse than it was four years ago. Two-thirds said they preferred Trump to handle the economy instead of Democrat Hillary Clinton, compared with less than half of the electorate overall.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Video: Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThese frustrations were not new. They had mounted for decades, boiling over in the slow recovery from the Great Recession. That was particularly true among men. From 1975 to 2014, according to census data analyzed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, white male workers without a college degree saw their median incomes fall by more than 20 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Their incomes fell 14 percent between 2007 and 2014.\n\nLast year, amid a much improved U.S. economy and a tightening labor market, their incomes had jumped by 6 percent, according to the Center's analysis. But that increase was nowhere close to enough to make up the ground lost in the recession \u2014 let alone since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely understandable how these workers feel left behind,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the center who is a former aide to Vice President Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, these working class whites have seen the fruits of American prosperity increasingly go to the very rich. \u201cSuperstar\u201d cities, like San Francisco, Boston and yes, Washington, gained even more wealth, and they have been responsible for an increasingly large share of the country's job growth.\n\nMeanwhile, non-college whites saw jobs go away and businesses fold in the rural communities and smaller cities where they are more likely to live, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\n\u201cTheir access to economic opportunity in large measure comes down to the luck of geography,\u201d said John Lettieri, co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group, an advocacy group whose research also showed that this group of voters is underrepresented in America's most prosperous regions.\n\nMany of the downtrodden areas have lost factory jobs over the last several decades, as expanding trade and advancing technology pushed the economy away from production work and into services. Some areas suffered as coal mines closed. Others experienced rapid growth in high-paying energy extraction and support jobs several years ago as hydraulic fracturing boomed, only to watch many of those jobs evaporate when oil prices fell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe workers increasingly came to see trade deals as the culprit \u2014 namely the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada in the 1990s and the effort to open up trade up trade with China in 2000, a decision that economic research suggested has cost America at least 2 million jobs on net.\n\nTrump courted working class whites by promising a restoration of the old industrial economy \u2014 through renegotiated trade deals and tariffs on imports; by pledging to deport immigrants, which he said would reduce competition for native-born workers; and by promising rapid economic growth from tax cuts, deregulation and more drilling.\n\nMany economists, including several conservative ones, warn Trump's plans will not deliver the relief those workers are seeking. Some say tariffs won't bring back jobs and could actually lead to recession. Others say Trump's plans ignore more critical issues for the working class, such as the need for improved worker training or measures to encourage workers to migrate to higher-opportunity regions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most disappointing part of the 2016 election,\u201d said Abby McCloskey, an economist who focuses on the middle class and who advised some of Trump's rivals for the GOP nomination. Like Clinton, she said, Trump had \u201cresorted to partisan talking points that the system is rigged against these workers.\u201d\n\nTrump's message did not resonate with black or Latino workers, who earn less at every education level than whites do. Those workers lean Democratic by various degrees but appeared especially repelled by Trump's attacks on immigrants and his stoking of racial resentments.\n\nCritically, his huge margins among blue-collar whites would not have sufficed to deliver him the presidency, if he had not also maintained a slim advantage among whites with college degrees as well. As a group, those workers have been the winners of the new economy, blessed with cheaper imported consumer goods and a persistent wage advantage over their non-college counterparts.\n\nTrump's challenge was inspiring the blue-collar whites without alienating the college-educated ones. He succeeded, and it won him the White House.\n\nScott Clement and Emily Guskin contributed to this report.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/how-trump-won-the-revenge-of-working-class-whites/"}}
