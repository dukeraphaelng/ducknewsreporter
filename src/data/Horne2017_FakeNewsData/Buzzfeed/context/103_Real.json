Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2014 widely seen as a dry run of sorts for the coming presidential debates \u2014 Mr. Lauer found himself besieged on Wednesday evening by critics of all political stripes, who accused the anchor of unfairness, sloppiness and even sexism in his handling of the event.\n\nGranted 30 minutes with each candidate, who appeared back-to-back at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan, Mr. Lauer devoted about a third of his time with Mrs. Clinton to questions about her use of a private email server, then seemed to rush through subsequent queries about weighty topics like domestic terror attacks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/matt-lauer-forum.html"}, "article2": {"title": "Donald Trump and the Iraq War", "content": "Summary\n\nDonald Trump has repeated throughout his presidential campaign that he opposed the Iraq war before the March 19, 2003 invasion, often taking credit for his judgement and vision \u2014 claiming he knew it would destabilize the Middle East.\n\nOn Feb. 13, in the most recent debate, Trump said: \u201cI said it loud and clear, \u2018You\u2019ll destabilize the Middle East.'\u201d In the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, Trump claimed that he \u201cfought very, very hard against us \u2026 going into Iraq,\u201d saying he could provide \u201c25 different stories\u201d to prove his opposition.\n\nTrump has even said that he was \u201cvisited by people from the White House\u201d in attempt to silence him, because, he said, he was getting \u201ca disproportionate amount of publicity\u201d for his opposition to the war.\n\nThere is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke against the war before it started, although we did find he expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war a few months after it started.\n\nOthers have looked, but no one else \u2014 including PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker \u2014 has been able to find any evidence to support his claims, either. Now, BuzzFeed reports that Trump indicated his support for war in a radio interview with shock jock Howard Stern on Sept. 11, 2002 \u2014 a little more than six months before the war started.\n\nStern asked Trump directly if he supported going to war with Iraq, and Trump hesitantly responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Trump still felt the same way in March of 2003. We do, however, know two things after having reviewed multiple news archival services in search of Trump\u2019s position on the war:\n\nTrump had a financial interest in opposing the war in the weeks leading up to the war. The Newark Star-Ledger, New Jersey\u2019s largest newspaper, reported on March 12, 2003 that Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts planned \u201cto sell $485 million in junk-grade bonds this week in an effort to avoid a cash crunch later this year.\u201d The uncertainty of war complicated Trump\u2019s bond sale.\n\nThe company began planning for the sale of the bonds in December, and it was completed March 13,2003 \u2014 six days before the war started. The Star-Ledger reported that \u201cthe growing threat of war with Iraq\u201dand a proposal to \u201craise casino taxes and install video slot machines at New Jersey\u2019s racetracks \u2026 made it more difficult for the company to find willing investors.\u201d\n\nAfter the sale of the bonds was completed, Trump issued a statement on March 13 saying he was pleased with the results \u201cdespite difficult capital market conditions and the looming threat of war.\u201d\n\nTrump expressed concerns about the cost of the war soon after it started. If Trump did support the war, he turned on it quickly. As the timeline below shows, Trump in July said that he wished the money being spent in Iraq could be spent in New York City. By November, he talked about the \u201ctremendous cost\u201d of the war and the \u201cvery, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq.\u201d\n\nBy 2004, Trump\u2019s opposition to the war was well documented.\n\nBelow is a timeline of all the Trump statements about the Iraq war that we could find in 2002 and 2003. Except for the Howard Stern interview in 2002, which was reported by BuzzFeed, the statements below were culled from numerous archival services available to us at FactCheck.org through the University of Pennsylvania: Access World News, ProQuest, Vanderbilt Television News Archives and LexisNexis.\n\nWe invite anyone \u2014 including the Trump campaign \u2014 to send us additional Trump statements about Iraq from either 2002 or 2003. We will add them to this timeline.\n\nAnalysis\n\nTrump Timeline\n\nSept. 11, 2002: Howard Stern asks Trump if he supports invading Iraq. Trump answers hesitantly. \u201cYeah, I guess so. You know, I wish it was, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nJan. 28, 2003: Trump appears on Fox Business\u2019 \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto,\u201d on the night of President Bush\u2019s State of the Union address. Trump says he expects to hear \u201ca lot of talk about Iraq and the problems,\u201d and the economy. He urges Bush to make a decision on Iraq. \u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack,\u201d he says. But he offers no opinion on what Bush should do.\n\nCavuto: If you had to sort of breakdown for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say? Trump: Well, I\u2019m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we\u2019re going in, we\u2019re not going in, the \u2014 you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. We have to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort like either do it or don\u2019t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we\u2019re going to attack, what routes we\u2019re taking, what kind of planes we\u2019re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I\u2019ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how \u2014 telling the enemy how we\u2019re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous. Cavuto: Well, the problem right there. Trump: Either you attack or you don\u2019t attack. Cavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you\u2019re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox. Trump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is \u2014 just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don\u2019t do it, or you \u2014 but I just \u2014 or if you don\u2019t do it, just don\u2019t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it. Cavuto: So you\u2019re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us. Trump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\n\nMarch 19, 2003: President George W. Bush announces in a televised address to the nation that the war with Iraq has started.\n\nMarch 21, 2003: Neil Cavuto of Fox Business interviews Trump about the impact of the Iraq war on the stock market. Trump says the war \u201clooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u201d and he predicts the market will \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq and Trump doesn\u2019t offer an opinion.\n\nTrump, March 21, 2003: Well, I think Wall Street\u2019s waiting to see what happens but even before the fact they\u2019re obviously taking it a little bit for granted that it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and I think this is really nothing compared to what you\u2019re going to see after the war is over. Cavuto: What do you mean? Trump: Well, I think Wall Street\u2019s just going to go up like a rocket even beyond and it\u2019s going to continue and \u2013 you know we have a strong and powerful country and let\u2019s hope it all works out. Cavuto: \u2026 Why are you so optimistic? Trump: Well, I think a couple of things. I really feel that the key is that interest rates \u2014 beyond the war interest rates are going to have to stay stable and low. That\u2019s going to be very important. And if you really look at Wall Street, Wall Street\u2019s come down thousands and thousands of points over the last number of years. So really, I remember when we were sitting here saying two years ago that Wall Street is going to be double what it was two years ago and a lot of people didn\u2019t believe that and I didn\u2019t believe that, but there were plenty of very intelligent people who said yes. I think that Wall Street will be going up and the market will be going up and there\u2019s great confidence in this great country. Cavuto: You know there is a feeling abroad, Donald, that the French don\u2019t like us, the Germans don\u2019t like us. There were protests abroad still continuing around the globe today from Asia to Africa and that there\u2019s going to be hell to pay that maybe some of these same people will prove their wrath by not investing in this country, by doing all sorts of nasty things, do you buy that? Trump: Well, the I guess the French never liked us much except when we were bailing them out, to be totally honest with you. But certainly were going to have to work on our public relations because there\u2019s no question there are a lot of countries right now that aren\u2019t too fond of us. I think that can be solved and probably pretty quickly. The main thing is to get the war over with and just make it a tremendously successful campaign and it will be very interesting to see what kind of weapons they find. Cavuto: \u2026 Does this put a chill on things economically? Does it scare people into buying [real estate] or not buying, renting and not renting? Trump: In a nutshell Neil, the office market is just okay at best. The hotel market is nonexistent. But the residential market for buying, for condos, has been the strongest I\u2019ve ever seen it. It\u2019s amazing. Now, a lot of that has to do I believe with interest rates. You know money is so cheap and people are buying and they are paying the lowest interest rates in 40 years. But the market has been very strong in that sense. There\u2019s been a lot of optimism in New York.\n\nMarch 22, 2003: The San Antonio Express-News quotes Trump as saying the \u201cwar is depressing.\u201d The article was about the Miss USA pageant, which Trump owned at the time. The pageant was held March 24, 2003 in Alamo City.\n\nSan Antonio Express-News, March 22, 2003: While terrorist attacks and the gloomy economy have taken their toll on New York, Trump said the Big Apple housing market remains strong because of low interest rates. And his casinos in Atlantic City still lure gamblers, he said. Trump, a bachelor since his marriage to Marla Maples ended in 1999, said the war with Iraq hasn\u2019t shaken his city. \u201cNew York is one of the safest cities in the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWar is depressing, but something like the Miss USA pageant is positive and brings you out of that funk.\u201d\n\nMarch 25, 2003: The Washington Post quotes Trump, at a post-Oscars Vanity Fair party, as saying the war is \u201ca mess.\u201d\n\nWashington Post, March 25, 2003: Donald Trump, with Amazonian beauty Melania Knauss at his side, pronounces on the war and the stock market: \u201cIf they keep fighting it the way they did today, they\u2019re going to have a real problem.\u201d Looking as pensive as a \u201cNightline\u201d talking head, the Donald concludes, \u201cThe war\u2019s a mess,\u201d before sweeping off into the crowd.\n\nTrump and the paper do not elaborate on exactly what he means by \u201ca mess.\u201d But we do know that the Oscars were held that year on March 23, which is also when it was reported that a U.S. missile accidentally downed a British fighter jet. We also know that Trump\u2019s remarks were in the context of the war\u2019s impact on the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 235 points the day after the war, but it dropped 307 points a day after the friendly fire incident.\n\nJuly 1, 2003: Trump appears on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews\u201d and expresses concern about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. He made his comment when he was asked about a quote Trump gave in February 2000 about the possibility of running for president.\n\nTrump, July 1, 2003: I never did run [in 2000] and I probably never will run. But we\u2019re having a lot of fun. I think the president is doing a very good job. I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.\n\nAs an aside, Trump, who lives in New York, was asked by Matthews who he would vote for in a hypothetical 2008 race between two New Yorkers: then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, or former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican. Trump refused to answer. Twice Trump said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question.\u201d\n\nSept. 11, 2003: Joe Scarborough, who at the time was host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cScarborough Country,\u201d airs interviews with New Yorkers \u2014 including Trump \u2014 on the second anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He asks about terrorism, the Iraq war and New York.\n\nTrump, Sept. 11, 2003: It wasn\u2019t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\n\nNov. 4, 2003: Trump appears on \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews,\u201d where he is asked about the impact of the economy on President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection bid. Trump says \u201cthe economy is doing well,\u201d but predicts \u201chis bigger problem is going to be what\u2019s happening in Iraq.\u201d Trump talks about the \u201ctremendous cost\u201d of the war and the \u201cvery, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq.\u201d He says, \u201cThe question is whether or not we should have been in Iraq in the first place.\u201d\n\nMatthews, Nov. 4, 2003: Let me ask you about the president\u2019s course from now until next election, until next November. How does it look over the next year? Is it going to stay up? I thought it was interesting that he low-balled this number. He said 7 percent, 7.2 percent, but don\u2019t count on it continuing. Is that smart politics? Trump: Well, I think it is smart politics. I think his bigger problem is going to be what\u2019s happening in Iraq. I believe the economy is doing well. I think it could get better, but lots of surprises out on the horizon, and what is going to happen with Iraq, what is going to happen with the world situation, that could be the bigger problem that President Bush has. Matthews: What is the economic impact? Is it the cost factor of about $100 billion a year for the military and the rebuilding, is that the cost, or is it psychological? Trump: Well, I think it\u2019s psychological. It is also tremendous amounts of money being pumped into Iraq. I mean, you look at states like New York and California, where they can`t afford school systems, and we are giving $87 billion to Iraq and that is just the beginning. So, you know, it is a tremendous cost to this country, what\u2019s gone on there, and again, we are getting some very, very unpleasant surprises in Iraq, and hopefully something is going to be done about it quickly. Matthews: This was an elective war. The president thought we had to do it. He made a judgment call. He took us into Iraq. Do you think he will reconsider that judgment as the costs rise? Trump: I don\u2019t think he is going to. He is a very committed guy, he\u2019s committed to that whole situation and I don\u2019t think he will really reconsider. I don\u2019t think he probably can at this point. Other people will, and you are going to find out at the polls whether or not those other people are right. I mean, you see more and more doves, if you call them doves. The question is whether or not we should have been in Iraq in the first place. I don\u2019t think that this president can do anything about that. He is really \u2014 he is on a course that has to stay. Matthews: Let me ask you about the Democrats. I have noticed a slight \u2014 or other people have noticed a slight shift in direction. Instead of whacking him on the economy, which is starting to look like his strong suit, they are shifting to the war. Is that smart? Trump: Well, I think that\u2019s the only thing they can do. I mean, the economy is good. New York City is having its best year ever perhaps in real estate. That is a very big indication. In California real estate, where I have a lot, same thing. I mean, the country is starting to do well, so I think the whole shift is going to be very much toward the war.\n\nDec. 15, 2003: Neil Cavuto of Fox Business interviews Trump two days after the capture of Iraq President Saddam Hussein. Hussein was captured on Dec. 13, 2003, a Saturday when the markets were closed. Trump says Hussein\u2019s capture was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d for the country, but he mentions that \u201ca lot of people [are] questioning\u201d the wisdom of going to war with Iraq in the first place.\n\nCavuto: What if this had happened today, Donald, in the middle of the trading day? What would the reaction have been then? Trump: Oh, I think it probably would have been even more positive. But ultimately, over the next year, two years, 10 years and 20 years, this is just a great thing for the free world. Cavuto: What if we got ahead of ourselves, though? What if, for example, the concerns of continued attacks in Iraq do not abate, that that\u2019s still a factor with us and maybe drags on for some time? Trump: Well, look, you have a lot of questions and a lot of people questioning the whole concept of going in, in the first place, Neil. But we are in, we went in, you had to find him. If he was alive, you had to find him. And you know, they fulfilled the pledge of finding Saddam Hussein. Cavuto: If you are the president\u2019s opponents, what do you do? Trump: Well, you have two mixed bags. I mean, you have Mr. [Howard] Dean, that\u2019s going to say we shouldn\u2019t have been there regardless. And you have others that are saying, well, we are there and we have to do the best. I mean, we are there, regardless of what should have been done. Some people agree and some people don\u2019t agree, but we are there. And if we are there, you have to take down Saddam Hussein. And they have done that, and they did it maybe not as quickly as they thought in terms of finding him, but they found him. And that is a huge day for this country.\n\n(Note: For those who are not reading this on our website please click here to see the latest version.)\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f108ced-4738-4cfa-8014-1a08792c3d6f\n\nSources\n\n\u201cThe CBS News Republican debate transcript, annotated.\u201d The Washington Post. 13 Feb 2016.\n\nBeckwith, Ryan Teague. \u201cTranscript: Read the Full Text of the Second Republican Debate.\u201d Time. 16 Sep 2015.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump: America can be greater than ever before.\u201d Transcript.

After announcing he'd ban Muslims from entering the country ten months ago, it's unclear if that policy still stands -- his campaign some times says he's expanded the policy and other times that he's limited it.\n\nAfter more than a year and a half of stadium rallies, around-the-clock interviews, sweeping primary wins, and one stunning general election victory, the Republican president-elect has the most contradictory and confusing platform in recent history.

Charles Rex Arbogast / AP\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n1. Build a wall, deport all undocumented immigrants.\n\nTrump's campaign began with a promise to build a wall across the United States\u2019 southern border and deport the country\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\n2. Deport all undocumented immigrants but bring the \"good\" ones back legally.\n\nIn a CNN interview in July 2015, Trump said, \u201cI want to move them out, and we\u2019re going to move them back in and let them be legal, but they have to be in here legally.\u201d\n\n3. Build the wall, deport criminals, triple the number of ICE officers, end birthright citizenship. In August 2015, Trump released a detailed, sprawling immigration plan that included a wide variety of ideas: Build the wall, make Mexico pay for it, deport criminal aliens, enhance penalties for overstaying visas, triple the number of ICE officers, pause immigration to try and employ unemployed Americans, cut worker visas and more. Trump's plan didn't detail how he'd enact most of his proposals, or how he'd pay for them. He's walked back or modified much of it since.\n\n4. Use a deportation force to implement policy.\n\nIn November 2015, Trump said he'd use a mass deportation force in order to remove the 11 million people.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And your going to do it humanely,\" Trump said in November on MSNBC.\n\n5. Trump might be flexible on actually deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nBuzzFeed reported in February 2016 that in off-the-record talks with The New York Times, Trump admitted this was just bluster and a starting point for negotiations, saying he might not deport the undocumented immigrants as he\u2019s promised. Trump has refused calls to release the transcript, despite furious requests from his rival candidates.\n\n6. Deport undocumented immigrants, but don't call it \"mass deportations.\"\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people \u2014 the most ever, and it\u2019s never reported. I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg News in June 2016 when pressed about his immigration policies.\n\nWhen asked more about how he'd characterize the deportations at the center of his immigration policy, Trump said he \"would not call it mass deportations.\"\n\n7. A deportation force is \"TBD.\"\n\nTrump's newly hired campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, dodged questions on the deportation force in August 2016 before saying that Trump's much-talked about deportation force from the primary was \"to be determined.\"\n\n8. \"I'm gonna do the same\" as past presidents.\n\nTrump championed President Obama's immigration strategy \u2014 deporting criminals first \u2014 in an interview with Fox News on Monday, August 22 when asked about how he'd deport 11 million illegal immigrants. He declined to answer questions of how he'd handle those who aren't criminals.\n\n9. I'm open to \"softening.\"\n\nThe next day, Trump told attendees of a town hall hosted by Fox News in Texas that he was open to \"softening\" laws to help immigrants already living in the United States peacefully. However, he followed that by saying that those who had overstayed visas \u2014 one of the key ways undocumented immigrants get into the U.S. \u2014 had to leave. \"You have to get them out. You have to get them out,\" Trump said.\n\nIt's unclear what or how he's softening his policy.\n\n10. \"There's no amnesty\" but \"we work with them.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday, August 24, Trump outlined an immigration plan that sounded an awful lot like the kind of path to legalization championed by Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 the very people Trump excoriated for weak immigration plans while he campaigned on a promise of mass deportations.\n\n\"No citizenship. Let me go a step further \u2014 they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,\" Trump said.\n\n11. Deport \"criminal illegal immigrants\" within one hour of being sworn in.\n\nTrump worked to sound strong on illegal immigration at an event in Iowa on Saturday, August 27 \u2014 even if he was simply presenting a warp-speed version of current policy.\n\n\u201cOn day one, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to get rid of the criminals, and it will happen within one hour\u201d of being sworn in.\n\nTrump did not discuss how he would approach the millions of other undocumented immigrants, nor did he explain how he could accomplish implementing current policy so quickly.\n\n12. What's the plan again?\n\nOn Sunday, August 28, three Trump surrogates took to the airwaves to insist that Trump's immigration plan hadn't changed. But their answers on what that plan actually was \u2014 and is \u2014 only added to the confusion.\n\nRunning mate Gov. Mike Pence said there would be no path to citizenship, while Gov. Chris Christie said there would be no legalization at all. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway dodged answering the question completely, simply saying he'd be humane.\n\n\u201cThe question is what to do,\" she said.\n\n13. A deportation force is not currently being discussed.\n\n\"He is not talking about a deportation force,\" Conway later said.\n\n14. The plan \u2014 whatever the plan is \u2014 has never changed.\n\n\"Absolutely consistent,\" said Pence.\n\n\"Completely consistent,\" said Christie.\n\n\"Pretty consistent,\" said Conway.\n\n15. Deport all undocumented immigrants in due time, using a deportation force.\n\nTwo more surrogates muddled Trump's immigration policy just days later.\n\nSon Donald Trump, Jr. told CNN on August 30 that his father hoped to deport everyone.\n\n\"That's been the same, correct. But again, you have to start with baby steps. You have to let ICE do their job, you have to eliminate sanctuary cities, you have to get rid of the criminals certainly first and foremost, you have to secure the border. These are common sense things, Anderson,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump surrogate Jack Kingston told MSNBC that a deportation force \"is part of it. We are going to learn more Wednesday.\"\n\n16. Don't worry, hardliners. There's no amnesty and Mexico will pay!\n\nIn a speech in Phoenix on September 1 Trump eased base concerns and re-upped his harsh immigration rhetoric by insisting that he would create a deportation task force, and there would be no \"amnesty.\"\n\nMere hours after meeting with the Mexican president who later said he'd told Trump that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall, Trump reiterated that he still planned to make Mexico pay for the wall.\n\n17. But \"there's really quite a bit of softening.\"\n\nLater the day, Trump was pressed by conservative commentator Laura Ingraham about what had happened to \"the softening\" of his policy. He said \"there's softening,\" but didn't indicate what, exactly, was softening.\n\n\"Look, we do it in a very humane way, and we\u2019re going to see with the people that are in the country. Obviously I want to get the gang members out, the drug peddlers out, I want to get the drug dealers out. We\u2019ve got a lot of people in this country that you can\u2019t have, and those people we\u2019ll get out,\" Trump said. \"And then we\u2019re going to make a decision at a later date once everything is stabilized ... I think you\u2019re going to see there\u2019s really quite a bit of softening.\"\n\n18. I won't rule out a path to citizenship.\n\nAsked September 6 if he'd rule out a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Trump declined.\n\n\"I'm not ruling out anything,\" Trump said. \"We're going to make that decision into the future. OK?\"\n\n19. We'll pay for the wall, Mexico will pay us back, OK? \u201cThe End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,\u201d Trump said on October 22nd, outlining the plans for his first 100 days in office. \u201cWith the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?\"\n\nCurrent position: Trump says he will deport millions, but he has not ruled out creating a pathway to citizenship. He'll build a wall, pay for said wall, but later he'll get reimbursed by Mexico.\n\nYOUNG UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n1. Dreamers can maybe stay.\n\nTrump wavered on what to do with the Dreamers \u2014 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children who are now afforded limited protection from deportation via the DREAM Act but no path to citizenship.\n\nWhen asked if Dreamers would have to go back, he said, \u201cIt depends.\u201d\n\n2. Nope, they can\u2019t stay.\n\nBy August 2015, that ambiguity was gone: \u201cThey have to go,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n3. End birthright citizenship.\n\nTrump first proposed ending the 14th Amendment \u2014 the Constitutional provision that grants citizenship to those born in the country \u2014 last August. This is something few in his party agree on, and it's even more unclear how it would be applied: Does it apply to children of mixed status parents, where one parent is illegal? Or simply those with two undocumented immigrant parents? Would he revoke the citizenship of the estimated 4.5 million children born to illegal immigrants already here?\n\nThe Trump campaign did not answer questions from reporters at the time.\n\n4. \"American children\" also deserve dreams.\n\n\"Where is the sanctuary for American children?\" Trump asked during a late August rally while alluding Dreamers.\n\n\"The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans,\u201d he said, offering up a rhetorical device in place of policy.\n\nCurrent position: Deport children benefiting from the DREAM Act, repeal the 14th Amendment to end birthright citizenship.\n\nPROPOSED MUSLIM BAN\n\n1. No Muslims should be allowed to enter the United States \u2014as immigrants or visitors.\n\nDonald Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d in a statement about \u201cpreventing Muslim immigration\u201d in December.\n\n2. Ban Muslims from entering but make an exception for friends and Muslims serving in the US military.\n\nHe later amended his stance in an interview with Fox News, saying the 5,000 Muslims serving the United States military would be exempt from the ban and allowed to return home from overseas deployments. He also suggested that current Muslim residents \u2014 like his \u201cmany Muslim friends\u201d \u2014 would be exempt, too, and able to come and go freely.\n\n3. The Muslim ban was just an suggestion.\n\n\u201cWe have a serious problem, and it\u2019s a temporary ban \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been called for yet, nobody\u2019s done it, this is just a suggestion until we find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Trump said on in mid-May, softening for the first time in months on the ban.\n\n4. Ban Muslims as a matter of policy, as well as people from countries with a history of terrorism.\n\nIn a national security address after the terror attack in Orlando, Trump said that if he\u2019s elected he would \u201csuspend immigration from areas of the world where there\u2019s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.\u201d\n\n5. Ban people from countries with a history of terrorism.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump how he'd feel about a Muslim Scot entering the U.S. while on a trip to visit his golf courses in Scotland, Trump said it \"wouldn't bother me.\" He then went on to emphasize that he did not want \"people coming in from the terror countries.\" When asked, Trump would not name one such country.\n\n6. Ban Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism, and potentially also other Muslims.\n\nThat same day, when pressed about how his statement in Scotland jived with Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country, spokesman Hope Hicks said that the ban would just apply to Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism. She would not, however, confirm that Muslims residing in peaceful countries would be exempt.\n\n7. The Muslim ban was never about Muslims.\n\nThe next week, a top spokesperson said the initial ban was not about Muslims.\n\n\"I know the news media has been reporting that the initial ban was against all Muslims, and that simply was not the case. It\u2019s simply for Muslim immigration, and Mr. Trump is adding specifics to clarify what his position is,\u201d Katrina Pierson told CNN, though advisers at the time said it was indeed about religion exclusively.\n\n8. Nothing has changed, nothing to see here.\n\n\u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d spokesperson Hope Hicks said when asked if the policies were changing and removing the word \"Muslim.\" \u201cThere has been no change from the exchanges over the weekend.\u201d\n\n9. The ban is negotiable.\n\nThen-campaign manager Paul Manafort in late May said the Muslim ban was negotiable, and how Trump initially articulated it was not what it would turn out in the end. Manafort said the policy is currently that \"where there is terrorist activity \u2014 Syria or Iraq \u2014 we will temporarily suspend immigration until we can establish a vetting system in which we can identify who people are who are coming in.\"\n\nThe government already has a rigorous, nine-step vetting process in place for refugees. Trump has previously included all Syrian refugees, including children and non-Muslims, in the ban.\n\n10. The ban would call for \"extreme vetting.\"\n\nMid July, Trump told \"60 Minutes\" that people from suspicious \"territories\" would receive \"a thing called 'extreme vetting.'\" He did not describe how \"extreme vetting\" would differ from the current vetting process.\n\n\"Call it whatever you want,\" Trump told CBS when asked if he was changing his previously released policy.\n\n11. The ban hasn\u2019t changed, I just don\u2019t like saying the word \u201cMuslim.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News in late July, Trump told Sean Hannity his position hadn\u2019t changed from his initial ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\n\u201cI think my position\u2019s gotten bigger, I\u2019m talking about territories now. People don't want me to say Muslim\u2014I guess I\u2019d prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we're talking about territories.\u201d\n\n12. There's a ban, plus \"extreme vetting\" that includes an ideological test.\n\n\u201cThe time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,\u201d Trump said in a speech in mid-August that reiterated his call for \"extreme vetting\" and reiterated that he'd temporarily ban immigration from some countries that he declined to identify.\n\nHe then proposed an ideological test for immigration.\n\n\u201cIn addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles \u2015 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law,\u201d he said.\n\n13. There's no way to really do an ideological test.\n\n\"We don't know if they have love or hate in their heart,\" Trump said in September, articulating the problem many onlookers have expressed about his ban. \"There's no way to tell.\"\n\n14. Only people who love America are allowed.\n\nLater, despite acknowledging the impossibility of the task, Trump maintained that an ideological test is key to the nation's immigration system.\n\n\"We want to make sure we\u2019re only admitting those into our country who support our values and love \u2013 and I mean love \u2013 our people,\" he said.\n\n15. The ban has \"morphed.\"\n\nTrump was pressed on whether or not the Muslim ban still exists during the second presidential debate, and insisted that it was now only extreme vetting.\n\n\"The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,\" Trump said, without actually saying whether or not the ban on travel still stands. \"It's called extreme vetting.\"\n\nCurrent position: Trump will not say whether or not he intends to ban people of Muslim faith from the U.S., but he will say that \"extreme vetting\" will apply to people from certain countries. It's unclear where those countries are, what \"extreme vetting\" entails or how he intends to institute an ideological test for entry.\n\nVISAS FOR HIGH-SKILLED WORKERS\n\n1. H-1B visas are bad for American workers.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration plan was published on his website in August 2015: it opposed the H-1B program, which allows non-immigrant visas for specialty occupations, arguing then that it was bad for American workers.\n\n2. H-1B visas are good.\n\nAt the CNBC debate in October, Trump denied that he\u2019d been critical about the program. \u201cI am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley,\u201d he said.\n\n3. H-1B visas are still bad, according to Trump\u2019s unchanged website.\n\nAt the Fox News debate on March 3, some five months later, Fox News host Megyn Kelly pressed Trump on which of these conflicting views he supports.\n\n4. H-1B visas are necessary: \u2019I\u2019m changing.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m changing. I\u2019m changing. We need highly skilled people in this country. If we can\u2019t do it, we will get them in. And we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have. So we do need highly skilled,\u201d he said.\n\n5. H-1B visas are definitely bad.\n\nHis campaign later released a statement reversing this shortly after the March 3 debate ended.\n\n\u201cMegyn Kelly asked about highly skilled immigration. The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,\u201d Trump wrote in a statement. \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\u201d\n\nHe reaffirmed this position in the GOP debate on March 10, one week later, vowing to end the program that he noted he uses himself as a businessman.\n\nCurrent position: Back where he started \u2014 against the H-1B visa program.\n\nBORDER CONTROL AND THE REFUGEE CRISIS\n\n1. The U.S. has a \u2018humanitarian\u2019 obligation to take in some Syrian refugees.\n\nTrump initially said the country should absorb Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cI hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have to,\u201d Trump told Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News on a Tuesday night in September. \u201cBut you know, it\u2019s living in hell in Syria. There\u2019s no question about it. They\u2019re living in hell, and something has to be done.\u201d\n\n2. The U.S. cannot and should not accept Syrian refugees.\n\nThe next day, Trump said the country couldn\u2019t welcome refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n\n\u201cLook, from a humanitarian standpoint, I\u2019d love to help. But we have our own problems,\u201d he said on Fox.\n\nDuring the March debate, Trump defended his changing view.\n\n\u201cFirst time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number. By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in, and I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\u201d\n\n3. Close the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on,\u201d Trump said on Fox News the morning of the Brussels attacks claimed by ISIS that killed at least 28 and injured more than 270.\n\n4. Don\u2019t close the border, just be careful.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say shut it down \u2014 I said you have to be very careful, you have to be careful on who\u2019s coming into our country,\u201d he said the same day as the Fox News interview on CBSN, reiterating that people from Syria without papers shouldn\u2019t be allowed in.\n\nCurrent position: Against closing the borders entirely. Against accepting Syrian refugees in the United States.\n\nDEFEATING ISIS\n\n1. Maybe send troops in. Definitely go after the oil fields.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first interview after announcing his bid, he signaled that he\u2019d both send in ground troops to Iraq and not send in ground troops.\n\n\u201cYou bomb the hell out of them, and then you encircle it, and then you go in,\u201d he told Bill O\u2019Reilly, who remarked that the plan necessitated ground forces. \u201cI disagree, I say that you can defeat ISIS by taking their wealth \u2014 their wealth is the oil.\u201d\n\n2. Bomb the oil fields. Send some troops in.\n\nOn CNN, Trump said, \u201cI would bomb the hell out of those oil fields. I wouldn\u2019t send many troops because you won\u2019t need them by the time I\u2019m finished.\u201d\n\n3. Send troops to defeat ISIS. Don\u2019t forget about the oil fields.\n\nIn a single August interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d he offered three solutions for what to do with the oil field profits: keep them, give them to veterans and their families, or, when pressed, perhaps give some to the Iraqi people.\n\nMonths later, in a March debate, Trump ballparked the number of troops he would need to send in to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would listen to the generals, but I\u2019m hearing numbers of 20,000-30,000.\u201d\n\n4. I've got this! I know more than the generals.\n\n\"I know more about ISIS than the generals do,\" Trump said in November in Iowa. \"Believe me.\"\n\n5. Destroy the oil. Let our regional allies send ground troops. If they don\u2019t, stop buying their oil.\n\nIn a foreign-policy focused interview with the New York Times published March 26, Trump said that the U.S. should \u201ctake\u201d ISIS\u2019 oil, but then said the U.S. should \u201cknock the hell out of the oil and do it because it\u2019s a primary source of money for ISIS.\u201d Trump also ruled out sending in U.S. troops, saying that other countries in the region \u2014 \u201cregional Arab partners\u201d such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 should provide the ground troops. If these countries did not, the United States would stop buying their oil and withhold \u201cprotection\u201d in the region.\n\n6. Declare war, send in some troops.\n\n\"We're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS,\" Trump said in his first interview with running mate Gov. Mike Pence. \"I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there.\u201d\n\nTrump said he\u2019d involve NATO, despite the fact that he has said the U.S. should withdraw from NATO, and the surrounding states, as well. He added that Hillary Clinton created ISIS. (PolitiFact deemed this statement to be false.)\n\n7. I'm going to ask the generals.\n\nMonths after saying he knew more than the generals, Trump said in early September that he'd ask them to map out a plan for defeating ISIS.\n\n\"Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS,\" he said. \"This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare.\"\n\n8. He's got a plan, and he'll tell you if asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you if that question is asked. He\u2019ll be happy to offer specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n9. Do more with computers.\n\nTrump cited his 10-year-old's proficiency with computers to argue that the U.S. needed to better fight ISIS using the internet.\n\n\"When you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game, ISIS,\" Trump said. \"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is \u2014 it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\"\n\nCurrent position: It's still unclear what Trump's plan to defeat ISIS is, but it will involve computers and it will be tough.\n\nGUNS\n\n1. Get rid of gun-free zones\n\nIn a speech at the National Rifle Association convention on May 20, where Trump was endorsed by the country\u2019s most powerful gun group, Trump promised again to do away with gun-free zones, which include schools and military bases. At a campaign stop in Vermont, he had previously vowed to get rid of gun-free zones on his \u201cfirst day.\u201d\n\n2. No guns in classrooms, except maybe some guns in classrooms.\n\nIn an interview on May 22, Trump advocated against, and then for, and then against, and then for guns in classrooms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly,\u201d Trump said, offering up two distinct views in an interview days after he was endorsed the NRA. \u201cBecause teachers, you know \u2014 things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable.\u201d\n\n3. I\u2019m not advocating for guns in classrooms, but wait, yes I am.\n\nTrump walked back his view that teachers should have guns a second later, then reiterated that some teachers should have guns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not advocating guns in classrooms,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut remember, in some cases \u2026 trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201d\n\n4. Let\u2019s put trained gunmen in schools.\n\nForty-eight hours later, Trump sought to clarify his muddled remarks, saying he wanted \u201cschool resource officers\u201d to have guns in schools while slamming rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s criticism of his stance.\n\n\u201cThe way she said it meant like every student should be sitting there carrying guns,\u201d Trump said on CNN on May 24. \u201cIf trained people had guns, you wouldn\u2019t have the carnage that you\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n5. We should only get rid of some gun-free zones.\n\nWhile he decried gun-free zones as \u201coffering up candy to bad people,\u201d he backed away from axing all of them, telling CNN in the May 24 interview that they would only be eliminated \u201cin some cases.\u201d\n\n6. More guns would save lives.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that he wished there were other armed individuals present during terror attacks to fight back.\n\n\u201cI think it would\u2019ve been a lot better if they had guns in that room, somebody could protect,\u201d Trump said after the San Bernardino shooting in December. \u201cThey could\u2019ve protected themselves if they had guns.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the deadly shooting in Orlando, Florida at a gay nightclub in June, Trump reiterated this view.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that some of the young people that were killed over the weekend didn\u2019t have guns, you know, attached to their hips, frankly, and you know where bullets could have flown in the opposite direction,\u201d he said on the \u201cHowie Carr Show\u201d on June 13, one day after the attack. \u201cThey had a security guard. Other than that there were no guns in the room. Had people been able to fire back, it would have been a much different outcome.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Atlanta on June 15, Trump declared that the outcome would have been different if \u201csome of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle.\u201d\n\n7. I didn\u2019t actually mean arming clubgoers.\n\nAfter he spent a week advocating for arming more of the victims (who were predominantly clubgoers, in addition to several club employees), Trump tweeted on June 20 that he didn\u2019t mean he wanted to arm clubgoers. Trump changed his stance just hours after the National Rifle Association pushed back against the idea of allowing people to bring weapons into nightclubs.\n\n\u201cI was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCurrent position: More guns are better, though the details are murky and evolving on how many gun-free zones would be abolished.\n\n'FIRST USE' AND NUCLEAR ARMS\n\n1. I wouldn't strike first.\n\nAsked during the first presidential debate about whether he'd support 'first use,\" an un-official U.S. prohibition on the use of nuclear weapons against enemies who don't have nuclear capability, Trump said he wouldn't strike first against rivals -- a completely different issue.\n\n\"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it,\" he said of nuclear weapons. \"But I would certainly not do first strike.\"\n\n2. Or maybe I would.\n\nShortly after saying he wouldn't do the first strike, Trump then reversed himself.\n\n\"At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there,\" he said.\n\nCurrent Position: It's unclear where Trump stands on \"first use,\" or if he'd be willing to strike first.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\n1. Against raising the minimum wage. Jobs would move to China.\n\nDuring the thick of the primaries, Trump repeatedly argued that raising the minimum would move jobs to countries like China. Speaking in the cold language of a businessman looking at his bottom line, Trump even seemed to indicate overall American wages, regardless of the law, were too generous already.\n\n\u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world,\u201d Trump said in a November debate hosted by Fox Business. Trump clarified afterwards that he did not believe American wages were too high, but he did make crystal clear he was fundamentally opposed to a minimum wage increase.\n\n2. Wages should be raised through economic growth.\n\nTrump in an interview with CNBC in May said he would prefer to try to raise wages through economic growth. His abrupt move toward a possible increase that he opposed in tough terms is a significant general election shift.\n\n3. Raise the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cI am looking at it, and I haven\u2019t decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more,\u201d Trump said on ABC on May 8, acknowledging that his statement was a shift when pressed.\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s a change. I\u2019m allowed to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my real minimum wage is going to be \u2014 I\u2019m going to bring companies back into this country, and they\u2019re going to make a lot more than the $15 even.\u201d\n\n4. Get rid of the federal minimum wage, leave it to the states.\n\nOn NBC on the same day, Trump said more specifically that he wanted states to mandate wages.\n\n\u201cLet me just tell you, I\u2019ve been traveling the country for many months. Since June 16, I\u2019m all over,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other.\u201d\n\n5. I want to increase it!\n\nIn a May 11 tweet criticizing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Trump argued that he was \"asking for increase\" of the federal minimum wage.\n\n6. States should change it, but it will hurt them.\n\n\u201cI actually think that the states should make the decision,\u201d Trump said in an interview with a Seattle radio station, but argued that \"In some cases, states are going to become noncompetitive, and they\u2019re going to start losing maybe jobs and losing business, and they\u2019re going to have to readjust. Otherwise, they\u2019re just not going to have anything.\u201d\n\n7. Let's make it $10 dollars an hour.\n\nAs the Washington Post notes, Trump's shift here are lengthy and significant: He says he would support raising it to $10 an hour, argues he never wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage, which he did.\n\n8. It should go up, but states should call the shots here.\n\nIn a June news conference, Trump said \u201cthe minimum wage has to go up. People are \u2014 at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states \u2014 federal \u2014 I think that states should really call the shot.\"\n\nCurrent position: Raise it to $10 an hour, ignore what I said before.\n\nTAXES\n\n1. The wealthy should pay more.\n\n\u201cI would take carried interest out, and I would let people making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they are paying very little tax and I think it\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg last August, noting that he\u2019d be OK paying more taxes. \u201cI want to lower taxes for the middle class.\u201d\n\n2. Cut taxes for the wealthy big time.\n\nIn September, Trump released a plan that silenced anti-tax critics with a proposal that slashed taxes for the wealthy by making the top marginal tax rate 25 percent. He radically simplified the tax plan by proposing just three brackets, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent. A whopping 67 percent of the overall cost of his individual tax cuts would go to the top 20 percent of earners, while 35 percent of it would go to the top 1 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis.\n\nHis plan is estimated to cut $10 trillion in tax revenue, which would be added to the national debt and deficit over a decade (more on Trump\u2019s flip-flopping position on paying off the national debt below). It\u2019s unclear how Trump would pay for such drastic cuts, but Trump insisted he could do it by offering the vague promise of striking better deals and cutting government waste.\n\n3. People like me should pay more.\n\nTrump was asked again in April during a \"TODAY\u201d town hall if he believed in raising taxes on the wealthy. Despite the big tax cuts for the wealthy outlined in his own tax plan, he said:\n\n\u201cI do, I do, including myself. I do.\u201d\n\nIn a series of interviews in early May, he claimed that his tax proposal was a starting point for negotiations and the taxes on the rich would go up.\n\nOn Sunday, May 8, Trump told ABC that taxes on the wealthy would \u201cgo up a little bit\u201d in negotiations and that, as a wealthy person himself, he is personally OK with higher taxes. \u201cI am willing to pay more. And you know what? Wealthy are willing to pay more. We\u2019ve had a very good run,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd something similar: It\u2019s all negotiable.\n\n\u201cUnder my proposal, it\u2019s the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far. But I\u2019m not under the illusion that that\u2019s going to pass. They\u2019re going to come to me. They\u2019re going to want to raise it for the rich. Frankly, they\u2019re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut the middle class has to be protected. The rich is probably going to end up paying more. And business might have to pay a little bit more. But we\u2019re giving a massive business tax cut.\u201d\n\nPressed on that last, confusing point \u2013 that business might pay more but also get a tax cut \u2013 Trump said he meant more than his existing proposal: \u201dExcuse me. I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer such a qualification for the wealthy until the next day.\n\n4. I never said that. Cut everyone\u2019s taxes!\n\nOn Monday, May 9, he went on CNN to refute what he\u2019d said the day before.\n\n\u201cI said that I may have to increase on the wealthy \u2014 I\u2019m not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class \u2014 now, if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they\u2019re still going to be paying less than they\u2019re paying now. I\u2019m not increasing it from this point, I\u2019m talking about increasing from my tax proposal,\u201d Trump told CNN, insisting that overall there would be a tax decrease for the rich and middle class alike.\n\n5. Maybe don\u2019t slash taxes by $10 trillion \u2014 slash taxes by $3 trillion, instead.\n\nTrump senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday at an RNC event that the tax plan had been revised to only slash taxes by $3 trillion \u2014 a third of what was initially proposed \u2014 and lower the top individual tax rate to between 30-33 percent, up from the 25 percent initially proposed but below the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent. The campaign did not confirm this.\n\n6. Scrap the earlier plan entirely. Here are new tax brackets.\n\nTrump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more closely mimic his party's past views on taxes.\n\n7. Maybe ditch, maybe keep a $1 trillion tax cut for small businesses (depending on who is asking).\n\nTrump publicly backed away from a trillion-dollar tax cut aimed at small businesses in order to optimistically claim that his tax plan won't add to the debt. But his campaign privately told a leading small business group he'd keep it.\n\nHis campaign then reiterated to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group that analyzes tax plans, that he'd definitely get rid of it, according to a report by the New York Times on what they called a \"trillion-dollar lie.\"\n\nCurrent position: Despite Trump's frequent talk about helping working people, his tax plan so far seems to mostly benefit the wealthy. It's unclear whether or not his plan will include that small business tax cut.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\n1. I don\u2019t believe in it.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t believe in climate change,\u201d he told CNN in September after a long history of calling it both a hoax and a Chinese invention to undermine U.S. business interests. In May 2016, he vowed to \u201crenegotiate \u2026 at a minimum\u201d the Paris climate agreement, one of the Obama administration\u2019s landmark achievements.\n\n2. Global warming is threatening one of my golf courses.\n\nA statement of environmental impact filed by the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, owned by Trump, cited rising sea levels and extreme weather due to global warming as the reason the company needed to build a seawall to protect its coastal resort, Politico reported Monday. The sea wall is necessary protect the course from \u201cglobal warming and its effects.\u201d\n\n3. I never said climate change was a hoax.\n\nDuring the first presidential debate in late September, Trump denied ever saying climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese (though you can still read his tweet on the matter here.)\n\n4. Trump believes in climate change, but not that it's man-made.\n\nTrump's campaign manager offered a more common Republican theory to explain Trump's views: Climate change is real, but it's \"naturally occurring.\"\n\nCurrent position: Global warming is real, but it's not man-made.\n\nNATIONAL DEBT\n\n1. Get rid of the national debt in 8 years.\n\nOn March 31, Trump told the Washington Post that the country needed to eliminate the national debt and that he could do it \u201cfairly quickly\u201d without raising taxes.\n\n\u201cI would say over a period of eight years,\u201d he said, arguing he could do it simply by renegotiating the country\u2019s trade deals. \u201cI\u2019m renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we\u2019re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We\u2019re losing with everybody.\u201d\n\n2. Only pay down a little. Invest in infrastructure first.\n\nThree weeks later, he told Fortune \u201cyou could pay off a percentage of it\u201d in a decade but he wouldn\u2019t advise being too aggressive because the country\u2019s infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and it\u2019s a good time to borrow.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how aggressive you want to be. I\u2019d rather not be so aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget: We have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military, which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren\u2019t being done, amazingly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an argument progressive liberal economists like Paul Krugman could have (and actually have) made. Not only is it far from his original position, it\u2019s far from his party\u2019s view on the issue.\n\n3. Pay off the debt by getting America\u2019s creditors to accept less.\n\nDespite the U.S. economy being fundamentally grounded in its ability to borrow at very low interest rates, Trump told CNBC that he would negotiate with creditors to get them to accept less than the full amount owed.\n\n\u201cI would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,\u201d Trump said.\n\nExperts say this idea is pure fantasy, no matter how good Trump\u2019s deal-making skills are. In addition to imperiling the economy, the proposal could also be unconstitutional.\n\n4. Don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 the U.S. can\u2019t default because we \u201cprint the money.\u201d\n\nA week after suggesting that he could get U.S. creditors to accept less than the full amount, Trump defended his stance on CNN by calling himself \u201cthe king of debt\u201d and railing against publications that reported his earlier proposal.\n\n\u201cPeople said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government,\u201d he said on CNN on May 9.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?\u201d\n\nHe then advocated for buying back some of the government\u2019s debt at a discount, using interest rates to save the country money. It\u2019s a strategy that works may work for businesses but would be more difficult, if not impossible for the U.S. government, economists told the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt \u2014 but you know, debt is tricky and it\u2019s dangerous, and you have to be careful and you have to know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said.\n\n5. I won't try to renegotiate the national debt.\n\n\u201cWe have to start chopping that debt down,\u201d Trump told CBS in June. \u201cI wouldn't renegotiate the debt. I'd negotiate, if I do a deal in a corporation, as an example, and if the economy goes bad, I'll oftentimes renegotiate that debt. But that's a different thing. That's just a corporate thing. And other people like me, very big people in the world of business, they do that.\u201d\n\n6. Take out new loans and pay back debt with new debt.\n\n\u201cI think it could be a good time to borrow and pay off debt, borrow debt, make longer-term debt,\u201d he said in the same June CBS interview.\n\n7. My plans are deficit neutral.\n\n\"It will be deficit neutral,\" Trump said of his economic plan released in September. \"It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\"\n\n8. Maybe borrow $10 trillion.\n\nOne of Trump's advisers echoed the skepticism many had of Trump's plans: that they would cost a lot more than Trump's tax plan would bring in.\n\nTom Barrack, an adviser, said Trump's policies would increase the national debt by $10 trillion \u2014 money the nation would have to borrow to accomplish Trump's plans.\n\nCurrent position: Either \"chop\" the national debt using an approach that is still unclear, or add $10 trillion to the debt to accomplish plans.\n\nABORTION\n\n1. Criminalize women who have abortions.\n\nThough Trump said in 1999 that he was \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d Trump has consistently claimed that he\u2019s against abortion, except for in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother\u2019s life, since starting his bid last June.\n\nBut during an exclusive interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews just after 1 p.m., Trump struggled to define his views on abortion aside from describing himself as \u201cpro-life.\u201d When continually pressed for how he\u2019d handle women who violated a theoretical ban on abortion, Trump said the \u201canswer is that there has to be some form of punishment, yeah.\u201d\n\n2. Let the states decide what to do about criminalizing abortion.\n\nAt 3:36 p.m., Trump put out a statement saying the issue is \u201cunclear and should be put back into the states for determination.\u201d\n\n3. Never mind. Don\u2019t punish the women.\n\nHe fully walked back his position that women should be punished for violating a theoretical abortion ban 80 minutes later, releasing a statement saying \u201cthe doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\u201d\n\n4. Probably overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states handle it.\n\nPressed three times in the final presidential debate on whether he hoped his anti-abortion Supreme Court nominees should overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said \"that will happen automatically in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.\"\n\nHe went on to say that after it's overturned states should handle it: \"I will say this. It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.\"\n\nCurrent position: Overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states decide it.\n\nWHETHER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN AMERICA\n\n1. I don't know.\n\n\"I really don't know. I mean, I don't know why he wouldn't release his records. But you know, honestly, I don't want to get into it,\" Trump said in July 2015, asked about his inaccurate, years-long insistence that the president wasn't born in the United States. (President Obama had released his long form birth certificate in 2011.)\n\n2. I don't want to answer the question.\n\n\"I don\u2019t talk about that anymore,\" Trump said on MSNBC in December 2015 in response to a question about whether or not he believed President Obama was born in the United States.\n\n3. I'll explain my theory one day.\n\n\"Who knows [if Obama is a natural-born citizen]? Who knows? Who cares right now? We're talking about something else, OK? I'm going to have my own theory on Obama. Someday I'll write a book, I'll do another book that will do successfully,\" Trump said in January 2016.\n\n4. I'll only answer that question at the \"right time.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump said mid-September 2016. \"I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\"\n\n5. The president was born in the United States. \"Period.\"\n\n\"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\u201d Trump said after a lengthy press conference touting his new hotel and veteran support.\n\n6. She started it, I finished it by getting the birth certificate.\n\nIn his dismissal of the conspiracy theory he'd championed, Trump inaccurately claimed that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton started the conspiracy theory.\n\n7. I only said it to \"get on\" with the campaign.\n\nAsked what changed to prompt his reversal after nurturing a conspiracy theory for five years, Trump said he acknowledged the president's birthplace to \"get on with \u2014 I wanted to get on with the campaign.\"\n\n8. I didn't say Obama was American because no one was asking.\n\nPressed in the first debate on September 26 on why Trump didn't lay the birther conspiracy to rest in the five years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate, Trump falsely claimed he didn't publicly affirm his belief that Obama is an American citizen because he wasn't asked.\n\n\"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\" Trump said. \"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it\"\n\n9. Clinton should apologize, not me.\n\nTrump inaccurately insisted, again, that Clinton's campaign started the rumor, and said she should apologize to the president for it.\n\nCurrent position: Trump said he believes Obama was born in the United States because it is better for his campaign, but he continues to inaccurately argue Clinton started the birther movement \u2014 and that she should apologize for it.\n\nVOTING FOR THE IRAQ WAR\n\n1. Clinton voted for the war, so she has bad judgment.\n\nTrump slammed Clinton in late June for her vote authorizing the invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started,\u201d he falsely stated in his June 22 speech. (There is no evidence he opposed the invasion, but there is ample evidence that he supported it.)\n\n2. It doesn\u2019t matter, people make mistakes.\n\nPressed on his running mate Pence\u2019s vote for the Iraq war in an interview on 60 Minutes, Trump said in July he didn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s a long time ago, and he voted that way and they were also misled.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,\u201d Trump declared, telling CBS\u2019 Lesley Stahl of Clinton that \u201cno, she\u2019s not\u201d allowed to make a mistake herself.\n\nCurrent position: It's OK that Trump's running mate voted for the Iraq war, but it's not OK that Clinton did.\n\n2011 INTERVENTION IN LIBYA\n\n1. The intervention in Libya by the U.S.-led coalition was a terrible idea.\n\nAsked in October 2015 if he felt the Middle East would be more stable with Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi and Iraq\u2019s authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein still in power, Trump told NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd, \u201cOf course it would be. You wouldn\u2019t have had your Benghazi situation, which is one thing which was just a terrible situation\u2026But of course, it would. Libya is \u2014 is not even \u2014 nobody even knows what\u2019s goin\u2019 on over there. It\u2019s not even a country anymore.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, he was pressed again on CNN to say whether he felt the two leaders of brutal regimes should have been left in power.\n\n\u201c100 percent,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Iraq used to be no terrorists. [Hussein] would kill the terrorists immediately, which is like now it\u2019s the Harvard of terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf you look at Iraq from years ago, I\u2019m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for terrorists. Right now, Libya, nobody even knows Libya \u2014 frankly, there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It\u2019s all broken up. They have no control. Nobody knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n2. I\u2019ve never offered a different opinion on Libya.\n\nWhen then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz brought up Trump\u2019s 2011 support for the intervention, which Trump offered at the time via a video blog, during a February debate, Trump denied having ever supported Gadhafi\u2019s ouster.\n\n\u201cHe said I was in favor in Libya,\u201d he said. \u201dI never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi would be in charge right now.\u201d\n\n3. I guess I did support an intervention.\n\nWhen CBS actually played the video of Trump discussing the subject \u2014 and supporting an intervention \u2014 in front of Trump in early June 2016, Trump changed his mind and acknowledged the past video.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big difference from what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was for something, but I wasn\u2019t for what we have right now.\u201d\n\n4. I wanted a surgical intervention, not a \u201cstrong\u201d intervention.\n\nWhen pressed during the CBS interview, Trump said he was for \u201csurgical\u201d intervention, not a \u201cstrong intervention.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mind surgical. And I said surgical. You do a surgical shot, and you take him out. But I wasn\u2019t for what happened. Look at the way - I mean, look at with Benghazi and with all of the problems that we\u2019ve had. It was handled horribly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think since then you\u2019ve said you were never for intervention, so it\u2019s confusing,\u201d CBS\u2019s John Dickerson countered.\n\n\u201cI was never for strong intervention. I could have seen surgical where you take out Gadhafi and his group,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n5. We really should have taken the oil in Libya, too, since we were there.\n\nIn the first debate, Trump inaccurately claimed ISIS now controls huge oil stores in Libya (they don't) and that the U.S. should have taken the oil after the intervention. (That would have violated the Geneva Conventions.)\n\nCurrent position: As Trump put it, \u201dI was for something, but I wasn\u2019t for what we have right now.\u201d That \"something\" seems to include violating the Geneva Conventions to seize Libyan oil.\n\nJAPAN AND NUKES\n\n1. Japan should have nuclear weapons.\n\nIn March, Trump said the U.S. should reconsider its policy of not allowing Japan to have nuclear weapons. He reiterated that view in April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea,\u201d Trump said on Fox News in April.\n\nHost Chris Wallace followed up, asking, \u201cWith nukes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIncluding with nukes, yes, including with nukes,\u201d Trump said.\n\n2. I never said that!\n\nBut at a Sacramento rally in June, Trump accused Clinton of lying when she repeated his view as an example of his unfitness when it comes to matters of national security.\n\nClinton \u201cmade a speech, she\u2019s making another one tomorrow, and they sent me a copy of the speech. And it was such lies about my foreign policy, that they said I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break,\u201d Trump said. \u201dSee they don\u2019t say it: I want Japan and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and many of the NATO states, nations, they owe us tremendously, we\u2019re taking care of all those people and what I want them to do is pay up.\u201d\n\nCurrent position: It\u2019s unclear whether Trump would reverse U.S. policy to allow Japan to have nuclear weapons, but it\u2019s clear Trump doesn\u2019t like being reminded of the previous positions he took.\n\nMONEY IN POLITICS\n\n1. Accepting donations means a candidate is controlled by special interests.\n\nTrump announced that he\u2019d self-fund his campaign when he announced his presidential bid. This, he said, time and time again would help him better serve the country against the corrupting force of money in politics.\n\n\u201cBy self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!\u201d he wrote in a September 5 Facebook post.\n\n2. People can donate to me as long as they don\u2019t want anything in return.\n\nDespite the self-funding promise, the Trump campaign quietly sent out fundraising emails, put a glossy donate option on its website and raked in millions. Still, Trump insists, it\u2019s about investment in the campaign \u2014 not the cash itself.\n\n\u201cI actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has to be no strings attached,\u201d he said in a CBS interview.\n\n3. The Trump campaign will not fully self-fund.\n\nTrump has said he won\u2019t self-fund like he did in the primary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be putting up money, but won\u2019t be completely self-funding,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal in a May 4 interview, noting that he\u2019s created a finance committee and will tap his base for money going into the general election. He\u2019s hired Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who has a history of political donations across both sides of the aisle, to head up the committee.\n\nThis is a reversal, but only in rhetorical terms, since Trump isn\u2019t exactly self-funding his primary campaign, despite his loud protestations to the contrary. PolitiFact dubs his claim \u201chalf true\u201d because Trump is pulling in big bucks from donors and most of his own contributions are technically loans or in-kind contributions, signaling that he may want to recoup those costs eventually.\n\nCurrent position: Political donations are fine when those donations benefit the Trump campaign.\n\nVIOLATING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH REGARD TO TORTURE, TERRORISM\n\n1. The military will obey potentially illegal orders.\n\nIn December, Trump started demanding that the US target the families of ISIS members in addition to \u201cbombing the sh*t\u201d out of the terrorist organization. He went further in February, advocating for torture as a method of interrogation.\n\n\u201cI would bring back waterboarding, and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\u201d Trump declared in the February debate just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Calls for bringing torture back became a regular applause line at rallies, despite the likelihood that both of these ideas would require the American military to obey orders that violate international laws and federal anti-torture statutes.\n\nPressed at a debate on March 3 over whether the American military would obey his order to violate international laws and the Geneva Convention to do such things, Trump insisted they\u2019d listen to him, despite condemnation from military leaders and conservatives.\n\n\u201cFrankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them,\u201d he said.\n\n2. The military shouldn\u2019t break the law, after all.\n\nHe then reversed this position the very next day, on March 4, in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, saying he \u201cwill not order military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters.\u201d\n\n3. The laws forbidding torture should be changed so no one has to break them.\n\nNot long after terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 28 people and injured dozens more on March 22, Trump called in to CNN to expand on his call to legalize waterboarding.\n\n\u201cLook, I think we have to change our law on the waterboarding thing, where they can chop off heads and drown people in cages, in heavy steel cages and we can\u2019t water board,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201dWe have to change our laws and we have to be able to fight at least on almost equal basis.\u201d\n\nWhen Blitzer reminded Trump that military leaders don\u2019t support torture and that it violates international agreements that the United States has signed, Trump called opposition to torture a \u201cpolitical decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that the eggheads that came up with this international law should turn on their television and watch CNN right now, because I\u2019m looking at scenes on CNN right now as I\u2019m speaking to you that are absolutely atrocious,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I would be willing to bet, when I am seeing all of the bodies laying all over the floor, including young, beautiful children laying dead on the floor, I would say if they watched that, maybe, just maybe they\u2019ll approve of waterboarding and other things.\u201d\n\nCurrent position: Trump says he\u2019s against violating international laws or ordering others to do so, but wants to change the laws to legalize, at minimum, waterboarding.\n\nKU KLUX KLAN AND DAVID DUKE\n\n1. 'I disavow, OK?\u2019\n\nAfter former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and white nationalist David Duke began encouraging his followers to vote for the Republican front-runner, including making a plea on his radio show on February 25, Trump initially disavowed Duke\u2019s support in a press conference on February 26.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? OK, all right. I disavow, OK?\u201d Trump said.\n\n2. \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. OK?\u2019\n\nAfter disavowing David Duke on a Friday, Trump was asked about the Ku Klux Klan and Duke by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday. Trump claimed to know nothing of Duke or the KKK.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. OK? I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, did he endorse me or what\u2019s going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you\u2019re asking me a question that I\u2019m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about,\u201d Trump said, refusing three times to unequivocally condemn the support of white supremacists until he knew more about them.\n\n3. 'I disavow, OK?\u2019 \u2014 part two.\n\nAfter that cagey song and dance-like interview sparked outrage, Trump took to Twitter to clarify, tweeting a video of his Friday press conference in which he did disavow Duke.\n\nAs I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016\n\nThe next day on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Trump blamed his refusal to condemn Duke and the KKK on a lousy earpiece but continued to hedge against disavowing the support of \u201cgroups\u201d he doesn\u2019t know anything about, despite Savannah Guthrie\u2019s reminder that in the interview in question, Trump had been only been asked about the KKK and Duke.\n\nCurrent position: Trump has disavowed Duke, despite a lengthy back-and-forth about whether he knows about him or not.\n\nTHE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n1. Keep the current deal with Iran, police it.\n\nTrump was one of the few Republicans who didn\u2019t immediately promise to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal. The author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d told his supporters that while it was the worst deal ever, they\u2019d probably have to live with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say, \u201cWe\u2019re ripping it up.\u2019 And the problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion,\u201d Trump said, referring to a high estimate of how many of Iran\u2019s assets will be unfrozen as part of the deal (the White House says after Iran\u2019s debts are paid, it\u2019s closer to $56 billion).\n\n\u201cBut I will police that deal,\u201d he said, touting his handling of business contracts. \u201cI would police that contract so tough that they don\u2019t have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.\u201d\n\n2. Renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nIn September, he went further.\n\n\u201cWhen I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran \u2014 right after I enable the immediate release of our American prisoners and ask Congress to impose new sanctions that stop Iran from having the ability to sponsor terrorism around the world,\u201d he wrote in an op-od for USA Today.\n\nCurrent position: Renegotiate the deal.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\n1. Repeal Obamacare. Look to Canada for inspiration.\n\nIn August, Trump was asked repeatedly if he still supported the single-payer health care he\u2019d touted in the past. He said America should have a private system but repeatedly praised Canada and Scotland\u2019s socialized system.\n\n\u201cAs far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here,\u201d Trump said. \u201dWhat I\u2019d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state \u2026 Get rid of the artificial lines, and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can\u2019t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\u201d\n\n2. Repeal Obamacare. Cover everybody.\n\n\u201cI am going to take care of everybody,\u201d Trump told CBS in September. \u201dI don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\n\n3. Repeal Obamacare, but \u2018I like the mandate\u2019\n\nDuring a CNN town hall on February 18, Trump started to answer a question about how he\u2019d replace the Affordable Care Act with health savings accounts, \u201cwhich are great,\u201d but interrupted himself to talk at length about how he\u2019s \u201ca self-funder.\u201d When pressed by interviewer Anderson Cooper about what would happen when Obamacare is repealed and the mandate disappeared, therefore allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, Trump said:\n\n\u201cWell, I like the mandate. OK. So here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different. I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets and I say this all the time.\u201d\n\n4. Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.\n\nTrump was mocked in the February 25 debate for being vague about how he would replace Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have many different plans. You\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans,\u201d he said at the debate, earning derision from Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n5. Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered.\n\nHis health care plan, finally released online in March, has far more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise for Canada suggested it might.\n\nIt would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\n\nIt offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace Medicaid, but it\u2019s not clear how or what those would look like, or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump\u2019s plan lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants \u201ccould generate a wide range of savings\u201d to the federal budget, but without details on them, it is \u201cimpossible to score any savings\u201d from his plan.\n\nCurrent position: Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.\n\nRIGGED ELECTION/POLITICAL SYSTEM\n\n1. It\u2019s rigged!\n\nLocked in a heated primary battle with Ted Cruz, Trump began alleging that the election was a \u201crigged, disgusting, dirty system.\u201d\n\n2. I won, so it's OK.\n\n\"You've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care. I don't care,\u201d Trump said in May when he secured the nomination.\n\n3. Be careful though, it's still rigged.\n\n\"Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" he said August 1st in Ohio in a claim PolitiFact rated 'pants on fire' wrong. \"People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?\"\n\n3. It\u2019s rigged by the media.\n\nWith polls showing Trump trailing Clinton consistently, he challenged the legitimacy of the election and the polls he once championed.\n\n\"The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president,\" Trump said October 15th.\n\n4. It\u2019s rigged by voter fraud and the media!\n\n\"The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,\" he tweeted.\n\n5. Everything\u2019s rigged!\n\n\"When the people who control the political power in our society can rig investigations like her investigation was rigged, can rig polls, you see these phony polls, and rig the media, they can wield absolute power over your life, your economy, and your country, and benefit big time by it. They control what you hear and what you don't hear. What is covered, how it's covered, even if it's covered at all,\" Trump said at a Florida rally on October 24th.\n\n6. It might not be rigged\n\nOnce the FBI announced that they'd review additional emails related to Clinton's time as Secretary of State that were obtained in a separate investigation, Trump told a crowd that maybe the system wasn't so rigged after all.\n\n\"But with what I\u2019ve just announced,\" Trump said in New Hampshire. \"It might not be as rigged as I thought, right? The FBI, I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. And they're going to save their great reputation by doing so.\"\n\n7. Our system is awesome when it works\n\n\"The FBI now has multiple open criminal investigations going on Hillary Clinton. Lots of bad things are happening, lots of really bad things are happening. But I'll tell you what, you're going to be amazed when it's all finished, when you look at how it's all fleshing out, the system is a beautiful system when it works,\" Trump said days later, inaccurately.\n\n8. It's definitely rigged.\n\nAfter the FBI announced that the additional emails had not changed their decision not to recommend charges against Clinton, Trump returned to arguing that the system was rigged in her favor.\n\n\"No, you have to understand. It's a rigged system, and she's protected,\" he said the Sunday before the election.\n\nCurrent position: The system is rigged, when the outcome doesn't align with what Trump wants.\n\nACCEPTING THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION\n\n1. \"If Hillary wins, I'll support her.\"\n\nPressed twice in the first debate, Trump said he'd accept the outcome of the race.\n\n\"I want to make America great again. I\u2019m going to be able to do it. I don\u2019t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\"\n\n2. Maybe, maybe not.\n\n\"I will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now, I'll look at it at the time,\" Trump said when asked if he'd accept the outcome of the election after alleging widespread voter fraud. Pressed again, he coyly said he'd keep it a secret: \"I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, OK?\"\n\n3. I'll accept it \u2014 if I win!\n\n\"I would like to promise and pledge, to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2014 if I win,\" he said to big cheers at a rally.\n\nCurrent position: If I win the presidency, I don't see a problem with our electoral system.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/full-list-donald-trump-s-rapidly-changing-policy-positions-n547801"}}
