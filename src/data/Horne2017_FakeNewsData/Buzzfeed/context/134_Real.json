{"foreign_id": "134_Real", "article1": {"title": "First They Came: Kasich Goes After Trump With Tough Video", "content": "The battle between Ohio Gov. John Kasich and GOP front-runner Donald Trump is heating up.\n\nA video released online Tuesday by the Kasich campaign attacks Trump for his rhetoric against various minority groups, invoking the theme of needing to stand up for people before it\u2019s too late. The video features retired Col. Tom Moe, a U.S. Air Force veteran and Vietnam POW, paraphrasing the famous words of late German pastor and concentration camp survivor Martin Niemoller:\n\n\u201cYou might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims must register with their government because you\u2019re not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says he\u2019s going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you\u2019re not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it\u2019s OK to rough up black protesters, because you\u2019re not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you\u2019re not one.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s turn toward racially charged fiction challenges the GOP\n\nThroughout the video, footage of Trump plays over Moe\u2019s voice, with headlines explaining Trump\u2019s statements on these issues.\n\n\u201cYou might not care about what Donald Trump says about,\u201d Moe continues. \u201cBut think about this: if he keeps going and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there\u2019s someone left to help you.\u201d\n\nThe comments are a take on Niemoller's \"First they came for the Socialists...\" poem.\n\nKasich has punched at Trump multiple times over the past few weeks, especially ahead of Trump\u2019s rally Monday night in Columbus, Ohio. Ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance, Kasich\u2019s team hosted several conference calls with surrogates and even impromptu press conferences with veterans. Ohio GOP Chair Matt Borges was in the press pen after Trump\u2019s speech, seemingly defending Kasich\u2019s record against Trump\u2019s, though Borges was not there in an official capacity for the campaign.\n\nPHOTOS - On the Stump: Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign\n\nTrump punched back at Kasich on Monday during his rally, making fun of the governor\u2019s low poll numbers in contrast to his own atop the GOP pack. Then again on Tuesday, this time in South Carolina, Trump said bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019re killing him. We\u2019re beating the governor of Ohio in his own state.\u201d Trump continued to mispronounce the governor\u2019s name \u2013 \u201cKay-sitch\u201d in lieu of the correct \u201cKay-sick\u201d \u2013 throughout his jabs at his fellow Republican rival. The two sparred during the past two Republican debates as well, arguments that gave Trump ample ammunition with which to rile and excite his supporters.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nWatch the video below:", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/first-they-came-kasich-goes-after-trump-tough-video-n469251"}, "article2": {"title": "John Kasich\u2019s Campaign Against Trump Never Stopped. And It Won\u2019t Till 2020.", "content": "One year after his failed run at president, John Kasich is plotting his path to another, his third, for 2020.\n\nYou\u2019ll remember Kasich from the last campaign, as his party caved to Donald Trump. At the Republican debates, he was the one at the farthest end of the stage \u2014 television Siberia \u2014 flapping his arms and shaking his head while making a case for himself as the voice of reason. \u201cThe debates were ridiculous,\u201d he told me recently over dinner at an Italian restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia. \u201cIt was a one-line, let-me-see-if-I-can-get-on-the-news-tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIt had been a long day, and Kasich was hoovering his spaghetti and clam sauce like a man who eats for fuel. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pitching myself. I was being myself.\u201d Earlier, Kasich had staked out his place in the Republican landscape: \u201cI think we need to be pro-environment. I think we need to be pro-immigrant \u2014 of course we need to protect our borders. I think we need to completely redo education. Every piece of education now is behind the times and a hundred years old. Look, I loved Ronald Reagan. I met Ronald Reagan. But Reagan was then. Now we gotta move on.\u201d He came to his point: \u201cI have a right to define what it means to be a conservative and what it means to be a Republican. I think my definition is a lot better than what the other people are doing.\u201d\n\nIn Kasich\u2019s view, the election of Trump and the complicity of party leaders represent a widespread abandonment of good American values \u2014 \u201ca momentary lapse of reason,\u201d he says, \u201cto quote Pink Floyd.\u201d A believing Christian, Kasich talks about his contrasting vision as a \u201crevival\u201d; he has a yearning to restore to American citizens the \u201cbasic principles of caring, of love, of compassion, of connectedness, of a legacy \u2026 There has to be a fundamental change, in my opinion, with all of us. I\u2019m willing to be part of that. I want my voice to be out there. I want it very, very much.\u201d\n\nKasich is perhaps an unusual standard-bearer for the Trump resistance, with a complicated relationship to the Republican Establishment in whose name he is now, functionally, crusading. He rose to prominence in Congress as a swaggering combatant during Newt Gingrich\u2019s revolution and, even having served as governor of Ohio since 2011 \u2014 an established Republican if ever there was one \u2014 he still thinks of himself as an upstart outsider. \u201cI was in the tea party before there was a tea party,\u201d he boasted when he was running for governor. While his lack of deference has populist appeal, in theory, it is not so welcome among certain wealthy Republican donors. During the 2016 primaries, the unsurrendering Kasich outlasted every other contender but raised only $37 million. (Jeb Bush, who dropped out five months before the convention, raised four times that much.) \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I have more money?\u201d he repeated to me, still somewhat bitter. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t want to create a leader, they don\u2019t want to make a winner, they want to follow a winner. People say, \u2018Do you want to run again?\u2019 All that other stuff. Well, how much money are you going to give me?\u201d\n\nIn person, Kasich is like a manic barkeep who talks too much but also makes some sense. Bill Paxon, a friend who served with him in Congress, describes his energy as \u201cthat of a 12-year-old boy with a frog in his pocket.\u201d He can be hyperfocused and detail-oriented but also, by turns, impatient, cranky, and self-regarding. I met with Kasich over several days, in Columbus, Washington, D.C., and New York, in a whirlwind that, a year before the midterms, nonetheless felt very much like a campaign tour. In a greenroom at MSNBC, after critiquing the hairstyles of the male guests on set, he wondered aloud how I thought he looked. \u201cDo I look youthful? What makes a person youthful?\u201d he asked, before veering off into the semantic differences between \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cmeek.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting time for a meditation on the varieties of political will. Kasich is not entirely alone in speaking out against his party\u2019s leader: Over recent months, a succession of Republicans have felt provoked or compelled to call out the president \u2014 most recently Senator Jeff Flake, who called Trump \u201creckless, outrageous, and undignified\u201d from the Senate floor and seemed, at least to many liberals, to be bravely speaking for a silent coalition. Two weeks earlier, Senator Bob Corker had called the White House \u201can adult-day-care center.\u201d But neither Corker or Flake is running for reelection. John McCain, who has also spoken out, is ill with cancer. Among those Republicans angling to retake the party from its current leader, it is Kasich who is the furthest ahead. He set himself up as a public enemy of Trump two full years ago \u2014 running an early campaign ad that compared the mogul to Hitler and another, well after Trump had sewn up the nomination, that was aimed at convention delegates and that presented a fantasyland in which he, not Trump, was the nominee.\n\nKasich, whose final term as governor ends in 2018, is still hawking that vision. He knows he faces a strategic imperative: He must dramatically expand his name recognition in this fallow period before the next race begins. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t fully appreciate,\u201d he writes in Two Paths, his account of the 2016 election that reads very much like a campaign book, \u201cwas how little known I was outside my home state of Ohio \u2026 It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t well known, I was learning. I wasn\u2019t known at all, and that would turn out to be a major strike against us.\u201d\n\nBut Kasich 2020 is not just a media proposition. Kasich is a sitting governor exploring a run against a president of his own party \u2014 a starkly unusual circumstance. He retains a skeletal campaign staff, and they are helping him to think through his options: Should he run as a Republican in the primaries or as an Independent in the general election? A primary run is plausible, strategists say, if Trump\u2019s approval ratings among Republicans fall below the high 70s, where they\u2019ve been, and Democrats prevail during the midterms, signaling a loosening of the stranglehold of the far-right base on the party. A third-party run is optimal if the major-party candidates represent ideological extremes. Kasich has not declared he\u2019s running, and everyone I spoke to preempted their hypotheticals with caveats. In the Trump era, two years is an eternity. \u201cLook,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a strategist who advised Mitt Romney on his 2012 run. \u201cWe could be at war with Iraq. We could be at war with Iraq and North Korea. We could be at war with Canada. Who knows?\u201d But among the party\u2019s intelligentsia, all agree there is a common wish that the White House be occupied by a different Republican.\n\nAny run by Kasich amounts to an open GOP rebellion, the declaration of a secessionist movement. Kasich threw down the gauntlet when, even under pressure from his party, he refused to endorse Trump. Gingrich, once Kasich\u2019s mentor, now regards Kasich as an apostate. \u201cHis behavior is not that of a regular Republican,\u201d Gingrich told me.\n\nKasich acknowledged being sanctimonious, even bullying sometimes. He is famous for his temper and has a reputation for late-night, wine-soaked \u201c2 a.m. on the porch\u201d debates, he says, which can necessitate contrite phone calls the following day. During the primary season, he made headlines for scolding a major GOP donor during a Koch-brothers conference when she questioned his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, lady,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when I get to the pearly gates, I\u2019m going to have an answer for what I\u2019ve done for the poor.\u201d Twenty people left the room.\n\nThis time around, on the advice of his handlers and his wife, Karen, he is trying to contain his high-minded anger and spin a virtue of his self-righteousness. \u201cYou think I\u2019m not nice?\u201d he asked me at dinner. \u201cDo I have a bad edge? A mean edge? A kind edge? Or an edge?\u201d But he conceded the point: \u201cPeople know that I will browbeat them into submission,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a state cabinet meeting in Ohio, I heard him tell a story featuring his friend, actor Warren Beatty. \u201cI said to him, \u2018You\u2019re so humble. You have so much humility!\u2019 I go to his house. There are no statues, no \u2014 you know \u2014 no posters, big Hollywood things.\u201d Then, as if to preempt an argument about his own grandiosity, he openly confessed to his flawed nature. \u201cMy biggest worry is that I will be hoisted on my own self-righteous petard.\u201d\n\nBut when I passed along Gingrich\u2019s comment, that he wished Kasich would be more like a \u201cregular\u201d Republican, Kasich\u2019s equanimity vanished.\n\nEven when controlled, Kasich holds his anger just beneath the surface: His jaw clenches and his long fingers twitch unconsciously and spastically, like minnows in a net. \u201cMaybe he should be one,\u201d is what he said.\n\nA primary challenge to an incumbent president is generally seen, in the American two-party system, as a kamikaze mission. This happened in 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter won. It happened again in 1980, when Ted Kennedy challenged Carter and Reagan won. An Independent bid is an even dicier proposition. Without the support of an established political infrastructure, a third-party candidate requires massive contributions to a cause whose prospects are very, very dim. Teddy Roosevelt tried it in 1912 and handed the election to Woodrow Wilson. The last time an Independent won a presidential race that included an incumbent was never.\n\nThese are not conventional times, and this is no longer the party of George W. Bush, who earlier this month implicitly rebuked Trump for his isolationism, nativism, and \u201ccasual cruelty.\u201d But though they wring their hands over Trump at private dinners, few elected Republicans have done much while in office to stand up to the president.\n\nIn one sense, Kasich has never stopped running against him. He stayed in the primary race until the bitter end and quit only when he ran out of runway. He went back to Ohio, wrote a book, and got right back in there. All along, he has had a very savvy co-pilot. In 2015, he hired the Republican strategist John Weaver to lead his primary bid, and Weaver \u2014 most known for John McCain\u2019s two presidential runs and the campaign bus he named Straight Talk Express \u2014 has remained on the payroll ever since. Kasich talks to Weaver many times a day from his flip phone. Weaver is known for his bleak temperament, and he nurses what can only be described as an unrestrained loathing of Trump. On Twitter, where he seems to live, he won\u2019t use the word president in connection with Trump without deploying quotation marks. \u201c \u2018President,\u2019 have you no shame?\u201d he wrote after Trump insulted the widow of a soldier slain in Niger. \u201cChump \u2018president,\u2019 \u201d he continued. \u201cEven by his (no) standards, disgusting.\u201d\n\nMy biggest worry is that I will be hoisted on my own self-righteous petard.\n\nBut Weaver has counseled Kasich not to follow his example and to keep his criticism to the policy realm. \u201cIf he reacted like I do to everything that the president does, he wouldn\u2019t get anything done,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe has chosen not to get into a character dispute with the president like Bob Corker did. I like Bob Corker, but he\u2019s voted with the president at every turn.\u201d The better tactic, Weaver believes, is for Kasich to embody the empathic, optimistic alternative to Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a happy warrior about how to move forward,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly counseling me to be on the sunny side of the street.\u201d\n\nIn Kasich, Weaver sees parallels to McCain \u2014 and opportunities to become what McCain never would be. He comes across as real and unpackaged; he has experience governing and cares about policy. \u201cEven more than McCain,\u201d Weaver adds, Kasich is focused on the lives of his constituents. In 2016, Kasich held a series of town halls, and at one, in February, a college student from Georgia stood up and told Kasich his story. A close friend had committed suicide, and his parents had divorced, and then his father got laid off. Wearing a giant Kasich sticker on his hunting vest, he asked the candidate for a hug. Both wept. Kasich, whose own parents were killed by a drunk driver as they sat in their car in a Burger King parking lot, mounted the stage like an Evangelical preacher. He said, \u201cThere are not enough people who are helping those who have no one to celebrate their victories, and we don\u2019t have enough people that sit down and cry with that young man. Don\u2019t you see, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about?\u201d\n\nThe town halls \u201cwere so intimate that you felt you were at a scene you shouldn\u2019t be at,\u201d Weaver says. He believes authenticity goes a long way with voters and that they will be forgiving of a candidate who is transparent about his failings and learns from his mistakes. Which may be why Kasich\u2019s stump speeches now include refrains like \u201cI\u2019m flawed,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fallen,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nBut voters want to hear about policy, too, and, at the moment, Kasich says he is staying in the middle lane. \u201cI got to make the tea party happy?\u201d he asked rhetorically during one of our conversations. \u201cI got to make the left wing happy? I don\u2019t look at it that way. I got a message that I think I can sell to anybody.\u201d His positions on health care are a case in point.\n\nKasich talks a lot about expanding Medicaid in Ohio, a move that automatically disqualified him from the White House in the minds of the right\u2019s hard-liners, for it implied an endorsement of Obamacare \u2014 the mechanism through which he was able to obtain that money and the disavowal of which had become the litmus test for true allegiance to the GOP. (Fellow conservatives in Ohio dubbed him a RINO \u2014 Republican in name only \u2014 and earlier this year Mike Pence attacked him for it, too.) But as governor, necessity prevailed over ideology. With a runaway drug problem in Ohio and rising ER visits and a growing elderly population, Kasich knew he could find a million uses for the money. \u201cWhen you become a governor, you take on a whole different role than if you\u2019re someone just living on Mars. It was not even a thing I had to think about,\u201d he said. In Ohio, nearly 700,000 people have received Medicaid expansion money, mostly for drug treatment and mental health.\n\nAnd in late August, as the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act reared its head for the second time, Kasich, together with John Hickenlooper, the Democratic governor of Colorado, released their plan to stabilize the health-insurance markets and preserve, at least temporarily, the ACA. In stark contrast to the blunt and hurried proposals by federal lawmakers, the Kasich-Hickenlooper plan was notable for its weediness. In a concession to the left, the plan expressed support for the individual mandate (a heresy in the Republican Congress). In a concession to the right, it insisted on making the waiver process more efficient and accessible. (The Alexander-Murray Obamacare fix circulating in Congress uses a similar approach.) When reports circulated that Kasich and Hickenlooper were planning a joint run for the White House, Kasich beat them back, protesting with a twinkle that no one can pronounce his name (rhymes with \u201cbasic\u201d) and Hickenlooper\u2019s won\u2019t fit on a bumper sticker.\n\nPractically speaking, \u201cmoderate\u201d is a winning stance only if Kasich runs as an Independent against candidates who represent the furthest, most motivated flanks of their parties: Trump on the right and someone like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren on the left. Then the whole vast center is up for grabs. And even in that case, \u201cthe first thing you\u2019re going to have to do is have a very significant legal budget to get on the ballot and then figure out how to get $100 to $150 million to run a general-election campaign,\u201d says Tom Rath, who served in Kasich\u2019s New Hampshire operation last time around. A centrist approach doesn\u2019t work if Kasich needs to win over the Republican-primary voters who continue to be Trump\u2019s hard-core fans. And it doesn\u2019t work if the Democrats put up another centrist like Joe Biden, who has Kasich\u2019s blue-collar authenticity \u2014 but with more charisma, more star power, whiter teeth, and a lot more name recognition.\n\nWhen I mentioned Biden, Kasich lit up \u2014 an insight into how he sees his position in the political marketplace and the challenge he faces building a coalition powerful enough to oppose the base within his own party.\n\nBiden, he told me, \u201cis very effective. He\u2019s an old lunch-bucket Democrat. He\u2019s a day at the mill and a shot and a beer and we\u2019re going to give everybody a chance. You may be struggling, and it costs too much for your kids to go to college, but your kids are going to be something. I don\u2019t know if the party wants it, because they\u2019re so far left now, dominated by a handful of elites that drive them harder and harder left. If you\u2019re a Democrat and you want to win, you have to figure out how to go around those gatekeepers.\u201d\n\nKasich preparing a response to a President Clinton radio address, 1995. Photo: Robert A. Reeder/Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nOne of the things Kasich likes best about governing is the chance it gives him to play Lone Ranger. I saw him bestow Ohio State football tickets on the family of two girls who were being bullied in school \u2014 and then also ask his staff to explore the possibility of moving the girls to a private Christian school run by a friend. In the elevator of a Washington, D.C., hotel, he offered a couple of middle-aged tourists, strangers, a tour of the floor of Congress. His staff regards him fondly and with exasperation: He refuses to hire a speechwriter. I saw him, several times, berate the people who work for him, including in the cabinet meeting, where he called out his higher-education secretary. \u201cThat stuff is dysfunctional!\u201d he said.\n\nKasich was born in a steel town near Pittsburgh. His father was a postal worker and a Democrat. He became a Republican because \u201cI don\u2019t like being told what the rules are,\u201d he told me. \u201cI kind of looked at the Democrats as very top-down, and I looked at the Republicans as more free-flow.\u201d The story goes that when he was a freshman at Ohio State, someone in his dorm broke a window and all the guys on the floor had to chip in to pay for it. Kasich, who didn\u2019t have disposable income, objected strenuously and went straight to the university\u2019s president to complain. The president, named Novice Fawcett, heard him out; then he mentioned that he was about to fly to D.C. to meet Richard Nixon and, capitulating to Kasich\u2019s entreaties, carried a letter from the student along. The letter earned him, at 18, a visit to Nixon in the Oval Office and an object lesson in the benefits of insistence.\n\nHe ran for state legislature when he was 26. By 30, he was elected to Congress. In the early days, \u201cwe were nobodies,\u201d remembers Dave Hobson, a fellow Republican representative from Ohio. \u201cWe were wandering in the wilderness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a car in Washington,\u201d said Hobson, and was always having to mooch a ride. \u201cJohn was cheap. He always was cheap.\u201d As a junior congressman, Kasich had a position on the House Budget Committee and became obsessed with balancing the budget, talking about almost nothing else, and in 1989 he presented his first budget to Congress. It received only 30 votes. \u201cIt was his friends and people who felt sorry for him.\u201d\n\nBut Kasich rose with the Republican tide that elevated Gingrich in 1994. At 42, he became chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Republican leadership \u2014 at a time when Gingrich was leading a wholesale remodeling of the party and the way it viewed the opposition. Today, Kasich sermonizes on the fundamental importance of political civility and the bipartisan process, but back then he was a star player for the increasingly bellicose and intransigent empowered right.\n\nGingrich\u2019s Contract With America promised massive tax cuts and a balanced budget by 2002. And in September 1995, Kasich, a good soldier, spearheaded the drafting of the representatives\u2019 budget. It contained cuts to student-loan programs, agricultural programs, space exploration, and subsidies for the working poor.\n\nIn June 1995, President Clinton vetoed that budget. The standoff continued through the fall, and in September, Kasich\u2019s committee proposed more drastic cuts, including a$270 billion reduction in Medicare spending. (It would not, he assured, jeopardize the quality or accessibility of health care at all.) In the winter, Congress gave Clinton an ultimatum: Pass the budget or we\u2019ll shut down the government. In a precursor to the present dysfunction, the two parties held their positions and refused to budge. \u201cIt\u2019s almost five to 12, and we\u2019re in the movie High Noon, and we\u2019re sitting in the saloon,\u201d Kasich said theatrically at a press conference in November of that year. Clinton vetoed it again, and the government shut down, for 27 days.\n\nBehind closed doors, Kasich was more of a problem-solver and wonky negotiator. He was on the bipartisan team that for almost a year hammered out a budget both sides could live with, which Clinton signed in April 1996.\n\nAlice Rivlin, the White House budget director at the time, has a photo hanging in her office of the principals in that negotiation: Clinton, Gingrich, Pete Domenici, Trent Lott, Bob Dole, and Leon Panetta, among others. Kasich is grinning like a Boy Scout. \u201cJohn looks so young,\u201d she says.\n\nPanetta, then Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, recalls Kasich as \u201cambitious\u201d and \u201ca good apostle,\u201d someone \u201cwho did not want to go out of his way to offend those in power in his party.\u201d But he did help steer his party toward a compromise agreement. Back then, there was a psychodrama to politics that everyone understood as a performance \u2014 \u201ca playacting,\u201d Panetta says, \u201cthat has to go on that conveys the impression that you\u2019re fighting the last battle.\u201d Both sides knew that they had no choice but to sit down together. Today, no one seems to understand that public bluster is only one-half of a policy fight, and Panetta speaks of Kasich with the fondness of an old war buddy. \u201cI could always pull him aside and say, \u2018Cut the b.s., John. You know what it means to do the right thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMy longest day with Kasich started in Columbus. Kasich had arrived home very early that morning from a field trip with staff to see his team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, play. After lunch, he signed a bill raising sentencing guidelines in certain cases of domestic abuse. Then the historian David McCullough, a fellow Pittsburghian, dropped in to give a brief talk to the cabinet, and the two shared a moment of mutual admiration and reminisced about the Duquesne Club, the elite gentleman\u2019s club where McCullough\u2019s father was a member and Kasich\u2019s was not. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I would walk past,\u201d Kasich said, describing just how far from Establishment power he felt as a child. \u201cThere was a red carpet, and there was a general out in front. My buddy and I would look inside, and he would step in front of us, and we\u2019d salute him. About 20 years ago, I found out who the general was. He was the doorman. Okay?\u201d\n\nThe McCullough meeting backed up into the cabinet meeting, where Kasich introduced and flattered an Amazon executive who was presenting a PowerPoint on customer service, then he hurried to an outdoor ceremony commemorating 9/11 in which a dozen Girl Scouts, nearly blue with cold, planted 3,000 flags on the statehouse lawn. In the meantime, all the statehouse speakers in the country had assembled for cocktails, and before assuming the podium to make his remarks, a standard speech about \u201cgoverning from the middle,\u201d Kasich got into a tussle with Robin Vos, the Republican speaker from Wisconsin, who amicably approached the governor and then swore at him for adding his name to a Supreme Court brief opposing Republican gerrymandering in Wisconsin. They had a heated exchange in which Vos accused Kasich of betraying his party. (Vos did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe governor was due to fly to Washington later that night so he could flog his joint-health-care plan the next day \u2014 the same day that Republican senators, this time Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, were trying once more to eviscerate the ACA. Here was Kasich at his most political, talking to Weaver on the phone; fielding a call from Rick Santorum, who was urging him to support the Republican plan; playing phone tag with Chris Christie; and counting votes from the front seat of the car. Kasich\u2019s health-care guy assured his boss that Graham-Cassidy was dead, or at least on life support, and then all of a sudden it wasn\u2019t again. And in the midst of all this, Kasich had a fight with his wife. One of his twin daughters had a school project due the next day \u2014 an interview with him, in fact \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t had time to answer the questions. You have to make time, his wife had said. This seemed to rattle him most of all.\n\nOn the flight east, I was pressing him to reflect on Trump \u2014 in particular, on the Republican Party\u2019s own historic role (and, by implication, his personal responsibility) in enabling Trump\u2019s rise. Kasich wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cHe\u2019s just a manifestation,\u201d Kasich said, \u201cof what\u2019s been happening for a long time. That\u2019s what I think. This has been a long journey down this road. Judge Bork. John Tower. Bill Clinton. Newt Gingrich. Tom Foley.\n\nJim Wright. I mean, come on. These were things that brought out the worst in people. Brought up controversy and a dividing of the political system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the tactical necessity of keeping to the high road \u2014 though, then again, maybe not. If these really are unprecedented times, and Trump an unprecedented disaster, then why does the Republican Party continue to insist on caution? If Kasich really is a man of conscience, then why doesn\u2019t he say what he thinks? \u201cWe\u2019re missing a sense of outrage about how far we\u2019ve diminished the dignity of the presidency. And how far we\u2019ve gone in the failure to acknowledge the responsibility that elected officials have to govern,\u201d said Panetta. \u201cI think Kasich has probably come as close as any Republican, but at some point it\u2019s the Republican willing to really acknowledge how bad things have gotten and how much of a tragedy Donald Trump is to our way of governing who\u2019s going to be able to break through politically.\u201d Kasich, when pushed on this, demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand on the stage and set myself on fire,\u201d he told me. He added, \u201cI have no reason at all to suspect corruption or criminal activity.\u201d\n\nOver dinner, Kasich acknowledged that he did try to take on Trump during the primaries. He defended the Iran nuclear deal. He said you couldn\u2019t kick all the Muslims out of the country. Trump voters booed him, he said. There was no space for even reasonable disagreement. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything that was, like, \u2018Rip their heads off,\u2019 because when you\u2019re a governor, you can\u2019t say crazy stuff because you actually have to be a governor.\u201d\n\nThen Kasich\u2019s Ohio communications guy, a slim, affable man named Jim Lynch, interjected with some governing business, mentioning that he\u2019d spoken to the organizers of the Ohio State Fair. Apparently the governor had expressed his displeasure at the bands playing there. He was interested in headliners who would reliably turn a profit. \u201cEverybody will come to see the Beach Boys. Everybody. Young, old, rich, poor, everybody.\u201d\n\nLynch wanted to raise the question of whose job it would be, going forward, to pick the bands, and Kasich cut him off. He didn\u2019t want Lynch or some liaison picking bands. \u201cWe\u2019ll go get the bands,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get Queen.\u201d\n\nI interrupted. But Freddie Mercury is dead.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name, Adam Lambert, is playing Freddie Mercury,\u201d Kasich said. (Lambert, an American Idol contestant, has become the front man for a new iteration of the glam-rock band.) \u201cHe\u2019s doing great.\u201d\n\nAs a younger man, Kasich had a reputation for loving rock and roll, and, at 39, even once tried to linger on the stage at a Grateful Dead concert. (He was removed by security.) I asked him what music he\u2019s listening to.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to get me into that stuff now?\u201d he asked. \u201cI like music. I\u2019m just not going to go down that path and be Mr. Cool. My music\u2019s appropriate, okay? People think that because of the music I listen to \u2014 it must be from my daughters. They\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m interested in your daughters\u2019 music, I said.\n\n\u201cMy wife and my daughter just went to see Lady Gaga. I do like Lady Gaga, I think she\u2019s fantastic. But I\u2019m a bit more into \u2026 I mean, I like Bieber. Okay?\u201d\n\nIn speeches, Kasich likes to talk about what he\u2019s done for Ohio. He cut the budget deficit by $8 billion (a figure disputed by some) and raised the surplus to $2 billion. He says he\u2019s created 400,000 jobs. Still, under Kasich, Ohioans \u2014 like so many in the industrial Midwest \u2014 are suffering. Ohio has one of the highest drug-related-death rates in the country; overdose deaths rose by a third to 4,000 last year. Job growth is lagging behind the national average, and wages are, too. College is costly, immigration and diversity are low, and infant mortality is 24 percent higher than the national rate. Certain of his innovations, taken from the conservative playbook, have had dubious effects. Kasich is a strong proponent of charter schools (and for-profit prisons), but he presides over a public-education system that dropped in Education Week\u2019s national rankings from fifth place in 2010 to 22nd in 2016. In 2011, Kasich endorsed the gutting of government unions (though it later failed a ballot referendum), and last year he signed a bill into law that bans all abortions after 20 weeks \u2014 and then boasted that he didn\u2019t sign the law that banned abortion after an audible fetal heartbeat.\n\nHis is, in fact, a rather conventional conservative r\u00e9sum\u00e9. That he\u2019s able to market himself as a moderate signals just how immoderate the right has become. And that he\u2019s able to market himself as a bomb-throwing outsider signals just how fully the party has thus far lined up behind its bomb-thrower-in-chief.\n\nBut on the flight from Columbus to Washington, D.C., Kasich didn\u2019t really want to talk about policy. (\u201cEverybody ought to just take a chill pill,\u201d he said later about abortion, adding that his wife is pro-choice and \u201cwe don\u2019t sit around arguing about this.\u201d) He didn\u2019t want to talk about politics. He didn\u2019t want to talk about who was responsible for the rise of Trump, or what Trump means for American history, or the risk Trump presents to our constitutional protections. \u201cThat\u2019s all small ball,\u201d he said to me.\n\n\u201cThe Trump thing is not what bothers me,\u201d Kasich added. \u201cWhat bothers me is when people across our society begin to say, \u2018Values don\u2019t matter.\u2019 Or, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in God.\u2019 That\u2019s what bothers me. It\u2019s depth.\u201d\n\nKasich joined St. Augustine, a six-year-old Anglican church in Westerville, Ohio, because he\u2019s friendly with the pastor. (The Anglican Church in North America broke away from the Episcopal denomination over the question of same-sex marriage; in 1996, Kasich voted against gay marriage and for the Defense of Marriage Act.) \u201cIt\u2019s not like I go to church and fall into some frozen state somewhere, or I raise my hands or roll around in the aisles.\n\nI go to church for two reasons. One is to say thank-you for my blessings. And two is because, as one minister told me, \u2018You showing up in church is good for the other people because you\u2019re a big shot, you know.\u2019 \u201d Kasich likes to read Christian authors, and if he likes what they have to say, he calls them up. \u201cI just called up the guy who runs Duke Divinity School and had a one-hour conversation. That\u2019s how I do things.\u201d\n\nWhat Kasich really wants to talk about is his belief that for the nation to heal itself, individual Americans must reclaim a higher sense of interconnectedness and personal responsibility, which has been lost in the pursuit of profits and celebrity. He is moved by the example of the Kardashians, who put up $500,000 to help the people of Houston after Hurricane Harvey. And he is moved that a golfer named Stacy Lewis, who hadn\u2019t won a tournament in three years, promised to give all her winnings to Houston, too, and then after she won, one of her sponsors doubled the sum. \u201cThese little acts of good and kindness, they matter. They make the world turn a little differently. Lawmakers, we have our place. Should you just bring back the days of the robber barons? Of course not. But we\u2019re not going to fix all the things that ail us by writing a law. If Donald Trump all of a sudden were not president, do you think everything would be great? Do you think all our problems would be fixed? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s like a steamroller when he gets going, and he shrugged me off when I suggested that enacting laws might be useful to protect people whose civil rights are endangered under Trump. \u201cYou want to wave a wand and make it go away. It\u2019s like, if you get to be fat, you didn\u2019t get to be fat overnight, and you won\u2019t get skinny overnight. You got fat over a period of time of doing things that are unhealthy. It doesn\u2019t get fixed overnight. That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating to people who yearn for a better situation, and that\u2019s why when I say there\u2019s no magic to it, this really bothers some people.\n\n\u201cWhat does the Jewish tradition say? It says, \u2018Repair the world.\u2019 I like that word repair, it\u2019s sort of a small word. Repair. I\u2019m going to repair my car. I\u2019m going to repair my socks. I\u2019m going to repair my house. You\u2019re not capable of anything beyond repair. None of us are,\u201d he said. Raising a good kid, doing a good job, being a good person \u2014 that should be enough. Kasich turned to his communications guy, Lynch. He wanted to know, did Lynch show me the Holocaust memorial?\n\nIn 2014, after a long fight, Kasich unveiled one of two Holocaust memorials erected on statehouse property. He was moved to do so after hearing a 77-year-old woman from Canton describe her escape from Lithuania, hiding in a dresser drawer as a 6-year-old girl while soldiers\u2019 dogs tried to sniff her out. Kasich\u2019s own daughters, Reese and Emma, were 11 at the time. It was at a local Holocaust remembrance event, and when Kasich took his turn at the podium, he said that the state of Ohio hadn\u2019t done enough to remember \u201cman\u2019s inhumanity to man.\u201d On the spot, he proposed an homage to rectify that oversight. Over the objections of his own Republican legislature, Kasich persisted until he wore everyone down. The memorial was designed by Daniel Libeskind, and Kasich is especially moved by the inscription, which quotes from the Talmud. \u201cIf you save one life, it is as if you have saved the world.\u201d He wanted to know why I hadn\u2019t seen it.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any downtime,\u201d said Lynch.\n\nKasich became hectoring. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you say, \u2018I want to take you for five minutes and show you this\u2019? Why wouldn\u2019t you take her out there so she could see the thing that says, \u2018If you save one life, you\u2019ve saved the world?\u2019 You did not do that.\u201d\n\nIt went on like that. Lynch tried again to protest, stammered, and then finally relented. \u201cI should have taken her, sir. Yes.\u201d\n\nThen, as the plane began its descent, Kasich presented us with an ethical dilemma. If one good woman saves a single Jew during the Holocaust, and Oskar Schindler saves a thousand, who is the better person? Lynch was silent. The chief of staff said Schindler. Kasich looked at me. \u201cThey\u2019re the same,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you!\u201d he shouted, slamming his palm on the armrest of his airplane seat. \u201cIt\u2019s quality, not quantity. The bigger platform you have, the more good you can do, but it doesn\u2019t make you better than the guy down the street.\u201d He chuckled, elated at having imparted this lesson. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 30, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.", "url": "https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/john-kasich-2020-challenge-against-donald-trump.html"}, "article3": {"title": "Trump Clashes With Rivals, Fox Moderators In First GOP Debate", "content": "Trump Clashes With Rivals, Fox Moderators In First GOP Debate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:36 p.m.\n\nAll eyes were on billionaire businessman Donald Trump on Thursday night \u2014 and he didn't disappoint.\n\nOn the very first question, Trump refused to promise to back the eventual GOP nominee \u2014 unless it's him \u2014 and wouldn't rule out launching a third-party bid. He jabbed at moderator Megyn Kelly when asked about his comments on women, called reporters \"a very dishonest lot,\" declared that \"our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid,\" and was unapologetic about his wealth and businesses.\n\nSince he announced in June, the reality TV star has risen quickly to the top of the polls, much to the chagrin of many in the GOP establishment, who worry about his controversial statements about Mexican immigrants and more.\n\nAnd it was clear those fears might be well-founded, especially if Trump does run as a third-party candidate. Polls show a Trump independent bid would pull votes from Republicans and, at this point, give the race to Democrat Hillary Clinton, if she's the nominee.\n\nTrump was at center stage since he's leading in the polls, flanked by the other candidates \u2014 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nThere were other clashes during the two-hour debate. Paul and Christie had a testy exchange over national security. Paul has supported rolling back NSA surveillance programs, but Christie has slammed him for those statements, saying it hampers national security.\n\nBush had to defend his positions on immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, and he tried to cast a more positive tone against Trump \u2014 drawing a notable contrast between the two.\n\nBoth Rubio and Walker tried to paint themselves as everymen and got good receptions. Paul argued he's a different kind of Republican who can reach out to different segments of voters. Carson came across as methodical, Huckabee brought his usual humor and Cruz passionately argued his conservative beliefs.\n\nKasich \u2014 who narrowly got into the debate \u2014 also didn't back down from his more controversial positions with conservatives, such as expanding Medicaid in his state and saying same-sex marriage was now the \"law of the land.\"\n\nThe main debate came just hours after the seven candidates who didn't make the cut met for what they had termed the \"Happy Hour Debate.\" Even then, the focus was on the top tier candidates, as the lower tier hopefuls took shots at Trump, Bush and even Kasich. Only former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina stood out and got rave reviews on social media from conservatives.\n\nYou can read our live blog of the two-hour debate below. And check out the NPR Politics team's live chat here.\n\n11:22 p.m. Here are the final debate speaking times, calculated by NPR Politics interns Lauren Leatherby and James Doubek:\n\n1. Trump 10:30\n\n2. Bush 8:33\n\n3. Huckabee 6:32\n\n4. tie Carson/Cruz 6:28\n\n6. Kasich 6:25\n\n7. Rubio 6:22\n\n8. Christie 6:03\n\n9. Walker 5:43\n\n10. Paul 4:51\n\n11 p.m. In their closing statements, the candidates mostly hew close to their talking points, but Carson stands out with his funny comments. Saying everyone has talked about things they've done, he has a unique one \u2014 separating conjoined twins. \"I'm the only one to take out half a brain. Though if you go to Washington, you'd think someone beat me to it.\"\n\n10:50 p.m. Candidates are asked about what God is teaching them while running for president. Cruz says he hears God every day through the Scriptures. Kasich says he believes in miracles and that God wants the U.S. to be strong.\n\nCarson is also asked about race relations. He says he was asked by an NPR reporter \"why I don't talk more about race relations,\" and it's because he's a neurosurgeon.\n\n10:45 p.m. Huckabee on transgender troops in the military: \"The military is not a social experiment. ... The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.\"\n\n10:42 p.m. Candidates begin criticizing the Obama administration on foreign policy and the Iran deal. It's Walker who gets in maybe the best zinger by turning it around to Hillary Clinton and her email scandal: \"China and Russia probably know more about Hillary Clinton's emails than members of the U.S. Congress do.\"\n\n10:33 p.m. Kasich, before a hometown crowd tonight, gets a positive response when he's asked about his position on same-sex marriage. While he says he an \"old fashioned\" guy and still believes marriage is between one man and one woman, he concedes that the Supreme Court's decision in June makes same-sex marriage the law of the land.\n\n\"Just because someone doesn't think the same way I do, doesn't mean we can't care about them,\" Kasich says, noting he went to a same-sex wedding just a few days ago. \"If God gives me unconditional love, I'm going to give it to my friends and family and the people around me.\"\n\nKasich so far hasn't backed down from this position and his support for Medicaid expansion that most conservatives disagree with.\n\n10:29 p.m. Trump is pressed on when he became a Republican and where he stands on abortion. He doesn't answer the first question, and as for abortion he falls back on a Republican talking point \u2014 he's evolved, just like Ronald Reagan.\n\nNext to him, Bush denies a report that he had unleashed on Trump. No harm, no foul, it seems, and Trump calls Bush a \"true gentleman.\"\n\n10:24 p.m. Bush has to defend his time on the Bloomberg foundation board, which gave money to Planned Parenthood. He says he didn't know about it at the time but that he doesn't regret sitting on the board \u2014 which he joined because of education reform. Notes he defunded Planned Parenthood as governor.\n\n10:18 p.m. The next question is over the Iran nuclear deal. Paul says Obama was negotiating from a \"place of weakness.\" Huckabee calls it a deal \"in which we got nothing.\" But even as they're debating this, the deal appears to be falling apart in Congress \u2014 soon-to-be Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has just come out saying he opposes the deal.\n\n10:14 p.m. Some of the most heated exchanges of the evening have been between Trump and the moderators. This time, Wallace gets under his skin when he presses him about his companies' bankruptcies. Trump, as usual, is unapologetic, saying he's simply \"taken advantage of the laws of the land\" as any good businessman would, and again touts his net worth of $10 billion, which some have said is overstated.\n\nWallace keeps pressing him over a Trump Entertainment venture in Atlantic City that went bankrupt, but he fires back at Wallace, \"You are living in a world of make-believe.\"\n\n10:06 p.m. Halfway through, we've calculated the talk time so far for each candidate. Trump is on top:\n\nTrump 5:06 Bush 4:29 Cruz 3:30 Rubio 3:00 Christie 2:50 Carson 2:45 Kasich 2:11 Huckabee 2:03 Paul 2:01 Walker 1:54\n\n10:04 p.m. Bush also defends his assertion that he can grow the economy at a 4 percent rate \u2014 despite the fact that hasn't been done in decades. \"We need to lift our spirit and have lofty expectations of this great country of ours,\" Bush says optimistically. My colleague Danielle Kurtzleben did a fact check on this earlier, finding his claim was unlikely.\n\n9:55 p.m. Bush gets the Common Core question \u2014 heretical to conservatives. Bush gives a passionate answer, though \u2014 \"We aren't going to compete in the world with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything\" \u2014 emphasizing he's for higher standards and not national requirements.\n\nBut Rubio, who saw Bush as onetime mentor, says, \"It should happen at the state and local level.\" While Common Core is a state-based program, the federal government has provided incentives if it is implemented.\n\n9:49 p.m. We're back to Trump. He's asked about his past support for a single payer health care system, but instead starts by answering a question he wasn't asked about the war on Iraq. \"I was the only one on this stage who had the vision\" to come out against the war, he says.\n\nHe does somewhat answer the health care question, saying the single payer system works in Canada, and in a different age, 15 years ago or so, it could have worked.\n\nPaul \u2014 the biggest attack dog against Trump so far \u2014 jumps in: \"News flash \u2014 the Republican Party has been fighting against a single payer health system for a decade.\"\n\nTrump, never without a retort, responds to Paul: \"I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight.\"\n\n9:39 p.m. Forget the Trump show \u2014 the Paul vs. Christie debate just burst into flames. Christie has been highly critical of Paul's push to end NSA wiretap programs, while Christie has said it's a crucial part of national security. Paul's position on this issue puts him at odds with most of the stage, but it's Christie who has gone on attack on him over this before. Now, it's out in the open.\n\n\"When you're sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot hair about things like that, you can say things like that,\" said Christie.\n\nPaul jabbed back, implying Christie was too close to Obama: \"If you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.\"\n\n\"The only hugs that I remember are the ones I gave to people who lost loved ones on Sept. 11,\" Christie responds. He became U.S. attorney for New Jersey on Sept. 10, 2001.\n\n9:32 p.m. Wallace tries to goad Kasich into criticizing Trump's rhetoric, but he surprisingly doesn't take the bait, admitting that Trump has \"touched a nerve.\"\n\n\"We need to take lessons from Donald Trump,\" said Kasich. \"If people want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake.\"\n\n9:25 p.m. Trump is pressed by Chris Wallace on specifics about his illegal immigration comments and where he got his statistics on Mexican immigrants. He still doesn't give any specifics, but boasts the field wouldn't be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for him (despite the fact it's been a pressing issue in Congress for several years now).\n\nInstead, he blames the media for turning his comments around. \"Reporters are a very disingenuous lot, generally\" he declares. Trump reiterates that a fence is needed but there can be a \"big, beautiful door\" in that wall where people can come through legally.\n\nTrump hits back that the U.S. leaders are stupid\" while the Mexican government is \"cunning ... they send the bad ones over.\"\n\n9:22 p.m. Bush says he stand behind his comments that illegal immigrants come here as \"an act of love.\" But he reiterates border security as a necessity.\n\n9:20 p.m. Kasich gets the Medicaid expansion question. It was a controversial move from the Republican governor among conservatives, and he was even attacked for it in the earlier debate. Kelly asks him about his faith informing that decision \u2014 would it cause him to expand all government programs. Kasich stands behind his decision, and argues Ohio is better off because of it, ticking off Ohio successes and budgets that weren't hurt by his decision.\n\n9:12 p.m. Another classic Trump moment. Moderator Megyn Kelly presses Trump on his controversial comments about women, including calling them \"pigs.\" Trump, unfazed, immediately jabs back, \"That was just Rosie O'Donnell.\"\n\nKelly isn't fazed either, and keeps pressing him. But Trump is unapologetic. \"Frankly, I don't have time for total political correctness,\" he says to cheers. \"What I say, oftentimes, it's fun, it's kidding. What I say is what I say,\" he says, and continues to hit Kelly. It's exchanges like these that have Republicans very worried and Democrats gleeful.\n\n9:10 p.m. Rubio gets a question about his personal finances, and he turns it back around as a hit against Clinton.\n\n\"If I'm our nominee how is Hillary going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?\" Rubio asks, noting he only recently paid off his student loans. This is where Rubio's perceived liabilities are an asset \u2014 his financial struggles are relatable in a way Clinton's aren't.\n\n9:05 p.m. It begins with the first question \u2014 when asked by moderator Bret Baier if any candidate would not pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee and not run as an independent, Trump raises his hand.\n\n\"I fully understand\" what this means, he says, to a smattering of cheers and boos.\n\nPaul, sensing his opening, immediately goes on the attack. \"He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already hedging his bets on the Clintons.\"\n\nIf you thought this was going to be a boring debate, think again.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/06/430153100/the-trump-show-begins"}}
