This decade-long decline was driven almost entirely by a decrease in unauthorized immigrants from Mexico, even as the numbers from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras increased. Meanwhile, a growing share of unauthorized immigrants were not people who had entered the country illegally, but had arrived legally and then overstayed their visas.\n\nMore recent data from the federal government show that 2018 saw an uptick in border apprehensions (which are often used as a proxy measure for unlawful entries). There were nearly 467,000 apprehensions at the southwest border last year, the most in any calendar year since at least 2012. Still, the number of apprehensions in 2018 remained far below the more than 1 million apprehensions per fiscal year routinely recorded during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\nAs Trump and Democrats press their cases about ways to end the government shutdown, here\u2019s a look at how Americans see illegal immigration \u2013 as well as their views toward the president\u2019s proposed expansion of the border wall and how much political leaders should be open to compromise:\n\n1The vast majority of immigrants in the U.S. are in the country legally \u2013 but fewer than half of Americans know that\u2019s the case. Lawful immigrants accounted for about three-quarters (76%) of all immigrants in the U.S. in 2016. But in a survey conducted in June 2018, only 45% of Americans correctly said most immigrants are in the country legally. Around a third of U.S. adults (35%) incorrectly said that most immigrants are in the country illegally, while 6% said about half of all immigrants are here illegally and half legally. Another 13% did not provide a response.\n\n2Republican and Democratic voters sharply disagree over whether illegal immigration is a major problem in the U.S. today. In a survey conducted ahead of last year\u2019s midterm elections, three-quarters of registered voters who planned to support the GOP candidate in their congressional district said illegal immigration was a very big problem in the country, versus just 19% among voters who planned to support their Democratic candidate for Congress.\n\n3 A majority of Americans (58%) oppose substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2013 as Trump has sought \u2013 while 40% support doing so, according to a January 2019 survey by the Center. Attitudes diverge sharply by party: Around eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (82%) support expanding the wall, while an even larger share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (93%) oppose it.\n\n4In the current stalemate over expanding the border wall, both opponents and supporters of the idea see political concessions as unacceptable, according to the January 2019 survey. Nearly nine-in-ten Americans who oppose expanding the border wall (88%) say it would be unacceptable for Congress to pass a bill that includes Trump\u2019s request for wall funding if that is the only way to end the government shutdown. Among the smaller group of Americans who support expanding the border wall, 72% say it would be unacceptable for Congress to pass a bill that does not include Trump\u2019s requested funding.\n\n5Many Americans disapprove of the way shutdown negotiations are being handled. A little over a third of Americans (36%) approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the negotiations, while the same share approves of the way congressional Republicans are handling the situation. Public views of Democratic leaders\u2019 handling of the shutdown talks are somewhat more positive than views of Trump or GOP leaders \u2013 still, less than half (43%) approve.\n\n6Disagreement between partisans extends to the effects of a wall. Around seven-in-ten Republicans (69%) say substantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration into the country, according to the January 2019 survey. About the same share of Democrats (70%) say it would not have much impact on illegal immigration into the U.S.\n\n7Proximity to the Mexican border is a factor in Republicans\u2019 views of a border wall. Republicans overwhelmingly favor building a wall along the entire border, but Republicans who live closer to the border are somewhat less likely to favor it, according to an analysis by the Center based on February 2017 survey data. The analysis found that 63% of Republicans who live within 350 miles of the border favor a wall along the entire border, compared with 74% of Republicans overall. Among Democrats, opposition to a wall is overwhelming regardless of their distance from the border.\n\n8 Long before the shutdown began, most Democrats \u2013 and nearly half of Republicans \u2013 said the U.S. would ultimately pay for a wall. Nearly nine-in-ten Democrats (87%) said in February 2017 that the U.S. would end up paying for a wall along the entire U.S. border with Mexico \u2013 a view shared by 46% of Republicans. Overall, seven-in-ten U.S. adults said the U.S. would ultimately pay for a wall, while just 16% said Mexico would pay for it.\n\n9Americans are more inclined to prefer politicians who stick to their positions than those who make compromises with people they disagree with (53% vs. 44%), according to a March 2018 survey. This marked a reversal from July 2017, when nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) said they preferred politicians who compromised and 39% said they preferred politicians who stick to their positions. In the 2018 survey, there was no difference between Republicans and Democrats in views of compromise. That was a change from the sentiment found in six prior surveys since 2011, in which Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favor politicians who compromised.\n\n10 Whatever else they think of him, about two-thirds of Americans (68%) \u2013 including around half of Democrats \u2013 say Trump stands up for what he believes in, according to a September 2018 survey. Around nine-in-ten Republicans (91%) say Trump stands up for his beliefs, as do 52% of Democrats \u2013 a far higher share of Democrats than give the president positive marks on other personal qualities, such as being a strong leader, being well-informed and being trustworthy.\n\n11Most Americans hoped for efforts at cooperation between Trump and Democratic leaders in the current Congress, according to a post-election survey conducted in November. More than eight-in-ten U.S. adults (84%) said Trump should cooperate either a great deal (39%) or a fair amount (45%) with Democratic leaders over the next two years. A smaller majority (65%), however, said Democratic leaders should cooperate with Trump a great deal (28%) or a fair amount (36%).\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published Jan. 11, 2019.", "url": "https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/16/how-americans-see-illegal-immigration-the-border-wall-and-political-compromise/"}, "article2": {"title": "How American Politics Went Insane", "content": "It\u2019s 2020, four years from now.

Congress and the White House seem incapable of working together on anything, even when their interests align.

The House burned through two more speakers and one \u201cacting\u201d speaker, a job invented following four speakerless months. The Senate, meanwhile, is tied in knots by wannabe presidents and aspiring talk-show hosts, who use the chamber as a social-media platform to build their brands by obstructing\u2014well, everything. The Defense Department is among hundreds of agencies that have not been reauthorized, the government has shut down three times, and, yes, it finally happened: The United States briefly defaulted on the national debt, precipitating a market collapse and an economic downturn. No one wanted that outcome, but no one was able to prevent it.\n\nAs the presidential primaries unfold, Kanye West is leading a fractured field of Democrats. The Republican front-runner is Phil Robertson, of Duck Dynasty fame. Elected governor of Louisiana only a few months ago, he is promising to defy the Washington establishment by never trimming his beard. Party elders have given up all pretense of being more than spectators, and most of the candidates have given up all pretense of party loyalty. On the debate stages, and everywhere else, anything goes.\n\nI could continue, but you get the gist. Yes, the political future I\u2019ve described is unreal. But it is also a linear extrapolation of several trends on vivid display right now. Astonishingly, the 2016 Republican presidential race has been dominated by a candidate who is not, in any meaningful sense, a Republican. According to registration records, since 1987 Donald Trump has been a Republican, then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican, then \u201cI do not wish to enroll in a party,\u201d then a Republican; he has donated to both parties; he has shown loyalty to and affinity for neither. The second-place candidate, Republican Senator Ted Cruz, built his brand by tearing down his party\u2019s: slurring the Senate Republican leader, railing against the Republican establishment, and closing the government as a career move.\n\nFormer presidential hopeful Jeb Bush called Donald Trump \u201ca chaos candidate.\u201d Unfortunately for Bush, Trump\u2019s supporters didn\u2019t mind. They liked that about him. (Charles Rex Arbogast / AP)\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 noisy breakdown has been echoed eerily, albeit less loudly, on the Democratic side, where, after the early primaries, one of the two remaining contestants for the nomination was not, in any meaningful sense, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders was an independent who switched to nominal Democratic affiliation on the day he filed for the New Hampshire primary, only three months before that election. He surged into second place by winning independents while losing Democrats. If it had been up to Democrats to choose their party\u2019s nominee, Sanders\u2019s bid would have collapsed after Super Tuesday. In their various ways, Trump, Cruz, and Sanders are demonstrating a new principle: The political parties no longer have either intelligible boundaries or enforceable norms, and, as a result, renegade political behavior pays.\n\nPolitical disintegration plagues Congress, too. House Republicans barely managed to elect a speaker last year. Congress did agree in the fall on a budget framework intended to keep the government open through the election\u2014a signal accomplishment, by today\u2019s low standards\u2014but by April, hard-line conservatives had revoked the deal, thereby humiliating the new speaker and potentially causing another shutdown crisis this fall. As of this writing, it\u2019s not clear whether the hard-liners will push to the brink, but the bigger point is this: If they do, there is not much that party leaders can do about it.\n\nAnd here is the still bigger point: The very term party leaders has become an anachronism. Although Capitol Hill and the campaign trail are miles apart, the breakdown in order in both places reflects the underlying reality that there no longer is any such thing as a party leader. There are only individual actors, pursuing their own political interests and ideological missions willy-nilly, like excited gas molecules in an overheated balloon.\n\nNo wonder Paul Ryan, taking the gavel as the new (and reluctant) House speaker in October, complained that the American people \u201clook at Washington, and all they see is chaos. What a relief to them it would be if we finally got our act together.\u201d No one seemed inclined to disagree. Nor was there much argument two months later when Jeb Bush, his presidential campaign sinking, used the c-word in a different but equally apt context. Donald Trump, he said, is \u201ca chaos candidate, and he\u2019d be a chaos president.\u201d Unfortunately for Bush, Trump\u2019s supporters didn\u2019t mind. They liked that about him.\n\nIn their different ways, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have demonstrated that the major political parties no longer have intelligible boundaries or enforceable norms. (Charlie Neibergall / AP)\n\nTrump, however, didn\u2019t cause the chaos. The chaos caused Trump. What we are seeing is not a temporary spasm of chaos but a chaos syndrome.\n\nChaos syndrome is a chronic decline in the political system\u2019s capacity for self-organization. It begins with the weakening of the institutions and brokers\u2014political parties, career politicians, and congressional leaders and committees\u2014that have historically held politicians accountable to one another and prevented everyone in the system from pursuing naked self-interest all the time. As these intermediaries\u2019 influence fades, politicians, activists, and voters all become more individualistic and unaccountable. The system atomizes. Chaos becomes the new normal\u2014both in campaigns and in the government itself.\n\nOur intricate, informal system of political intermediation, which took many decades to build, did not commit suicide or die of old age; we reformed it to death. For decades, well-meaning political reformers have attacked intermediaries as corrupt, undemocratic, unnecessary, or (usually) all of the above. Americans have been busy demonizing and disempowering political professionals and parties, which is like spending decades abusing and attacking your own immune system. Eventually, you will get sick.\n\nThe disorder has other causes, too: developments such as ideological polarization, the rise of social media, and the radicalization of the Republican base. But chaos syndrome compounds the effects of those developments, by impeding the task of organizing to counteract them. Insurgencies in presidential races and on Capitol Hill are nothing new, and they are not necessarily bad, as long as the governing process can accommodate them. Years before the Senate had to cope with Ted Cruz, it had to cope with Jesse Helms. The difference is that Cruz shut down the government, which Helms could not have done had he even imagined trying.\n\nLike many disorders, chaos syndrome is self-reinforcing. It causes governmental dysfunction, which fuels public anger, which incites political disruption, which causes yet more governmental dysfunction. Reversing the spiral will require understanding it. Consider, then, the etiology of a political disease: the immune system that defended the body politic for two centuries; the gradual dismantling of that immune system; the emergence of pathogens capable of exploiting the new vulnerability; the symptoms of the disorder; and, finally, its prognosis and treatment.\n\nImmunity\n\nWhy the political class is a good thing\n\nThe Founders knew all too well about chaos. It was the condition that brought them together in 1787 under the Articles of Confederation. The central government had too few powers and powers of the wrong kinds, so they gave it more powers, and also multiple power centers. The core idea of the Constitution was to restrain ambition and excess by forcing competing powers and factions to bargain and compromise.\n\nThe Framers worried about demagogic excess and populist caprice, so they created buffers and gatekeepers between voters and the government. Only one chamber, the House of Representatives, would be directly elected. A radical who wanted to get into the Senate would need to get past the state legislature, which selected senators; a usurper who wanted to seize the presidency would need to get past the Electoral College, a convocation of elders who chose the president; and so on.\n\nThey were visionaries, those men in Philadelphia, but they could not foresee everything, and they made a serious omission. Unlike the British parliamentary system, the Constitution makes no provision for holding politicians accountable to one another. A rogue member of Congress can\u2019t be \u201cfired\u201d by his party leaders, as a member of Parliament can; a renegade president cannot be evicted in a vote of no confidence, as a British prime minister can. By and large, American politicians are independent operators, and they became even more independent when later reforms, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, neutered the Electoral College and established direct election to the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proved unable to rein in Ted Cruz. (Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call / Getty)\n\nThe Constitution makes no mention of many of the essential political structures that we take for granted, such as political parties and congressional committees. If the Constitution were all we had, politicians would be incapable of getting organized to accomplish even routine tasks. Every day, for every bill or compromise, they would have to start from scratch, rounding up hundreds of individual politicians and answering to thousands of squabbling constituencies and millions of voters. By itself, the Constitution is a recipe for chaos.\n\nSo Americans developed a second, unwritten constitution. Beginning in the 1790s, politicians sorted themselves into parties. In the 1830s, under Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, the parties established patronage machines and grass-roots bases. The machines and parties used rewards and the occasional punishment to encourage politicians to work together. Meanwhile, Congress developed its seniority and committee systems, rewarding reliability and establishing cooperative routines. Parties, leaders, machines, and congressional hierarchies built densely woven incentive structures that bound politicians into coherent teams. Personal alliances, financial contributions, promotions and prestige, political perks, pork-barrel spending, endorsements, and sometimes a trip to the woodshed or the wilderness: All of those incentives and others, including some of dubious respectability, came into play. If the Constitution was the system\u2019s DNA, the parties and machines and political brokers were its RNA, translating the Founders\u2019 bare-bones framework into dynamic organizations and thus converting conflict into action.\n\nThe informal constitution\u2019s intermediaries have many names and faces: state and national party committees, county party chairs, congressional subcommittees, leadership pacs, convention delegates, bundlers, and countless more. For purposes of this essay, I\u2019ll call them all middlemen, because all of them mediated between disorganized swarms of politicians and disorganized swarms of voters, thereby performing the indispensable task that the great political scientist James Q. Wilson called \u201cassembling power in the formal government.\u201d\n\nThe middlemen could be undemocratic, high-handed, devious, secretive. But they had one great virtue: They brought order from chaos. They encouraged coordination, interdependency, and mutual accountability. They discouraged solipsistic and antisocial political behavior. A loyal, time-serving member of Congress could expect easy renomination, financial help, promotion through the ranks of committees and leadership jobs, and a new airport or research center for his district. A turncoat or troublemaker, by contrast, could expect to encounter ostracism, marginalization, and difficulties with fund-raising. The system was hierarchical, but it was not authoritarian. Even the lowliest precinct walker or officeholder had a role and a voice and could expect a reward for loyalty; even the highest party boss had to cater to multiple constituencies and fend off periodic challengers.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has already faced a rebellion. The reality is that there no longer is any such thing as a \u201cparty leader.\u201d (Cliff Owen / AP)\n\nParties, machines, and hacks may not have been pretty, but at their best they did their job so well that the country forgot why it needed them. Politics seemed almost to organize itself, but only because the middlemen recruited and nurtured political talent, vetted candidates for competence and loyalty, gathered and dispensed money, built bases of donors and supporters, forged coalitions, bought off antagonists, mediated disputes, brokered compromises, and greased the skids to turn those compromises into law. Though sometimes arrogant, middlemen were not generally elitist. They excelled at organizing and representing unsophisticated voters, as Tammany Hall famously did for the working-class Irish of New York, to the horror of many Progressives who viewed the Irish working class as unfit to govern or even to vote.\n\nThe old machines were inclusive only by the standards of their day, of course. They were bad on race\u2014but then, so were Progressives such as Woodrow Wilson. The more intrinsic hazard with middlemen and machines is the ever-present potential for corruption, which is a real problem. On the other hand, overreacting to the threat of corruption by stamping out influence-peddling (as distinct from bribery and extortion) is just as harmful. Political contributions, for example, look unseemly, but they play a vital role as political bonding agents. When a party raised a soft-money donation from a millionaire and used it to support a candidate\u2019s campaign (a common practice until the 2002 McCain-Feingold law banned it in federal elections), the exchange of favors tied a knot of mutual accountability that linked candidate, party, and donor together and forced each to think about the interests of the others. Such transactions may not have comported with the Platonic ideal of democracy, but in the real world they did much to stabilize the system and discourage selfish behavior.\n\nMiddlemen have a characteristic that is essential in politics: They stick around. Because careerists and hacks make their living off the system, they have a stake in assembling durable coalitions, in retaining power over time, and in keeping the government in functioning order. Slash-and-burn protests and quixotic ideological crusades are luxuries they can\u2019t afford. Insurgents and renegades have a role, which is to jolt the system with new energy and ideas; but professionals also have a role, which is to safely absorb the energy that insurgents unleash. Think of them as analogous to antibodies and white blood cells, establishing and patrolling the barriers between the body politic and would-be hijackers on the outside. As with biology, so with politics: When the immune system works, it is largely invisible. Only when it breaks down do we become aware of its importance.\n\nVulnerability\n\nHow the war on middlemen left America defenseless\n\nBeginning early in the 20th century, and continuing right up to the present, reformers and the public turned against every aspect of insider politics: professional politicians, closed-door negotiations, personal favors, party bosses, financial ties, all of it. Progressives accused middlemen of subverting the public interest; populists accused them of obstructing the people\u2019s will; conservatives accused them of protecting and expanding big government.\n\nTo some extent, the reformers were right. They had good intentions and valid complaints. Back in the 1970s, as a teenager in the post-Watergate era, I was on their side. Why allow politicians ever to meet behind closed doors? Sunshine is the best disinfectant! Why allow private money to buy favors and distort policy making? Ban it and use Treasury funds to finance elections! It was easy, in those days, to see that there was dirty water in the tub. What was not so evident was the reason the water was dirty, which was the baby. So we started reforming.\n\nWe reformed the nominating process. The use of primary elections instead of conventions, caucuses, and other insider-dominated processes dates to the era of Theodore Roosevelt, but primary elections and party influence coexisted through the 1960s; especially in congressional and state races, party leaders had many ways to influence nominations and vet candidates. According to Jon Meacham, in his biography of George H. W. Bush, here is how Bush\u2019s father, Prescott Bush, got started in politics: \u201cSamuel F. Pryor, a top Pan Am executive and a mover in Connecticut politics, called Prescott to ask whether Bush might like to run for Congress. \u2018If you would,\u2019 Pryor said, \u2018I think we can assure you that you\u2019ll be the nominee.\u2019 \u201d Today, party insiders can still jawbone a little bit, but, as the 2016 presidential race has made all too clear, there is startlingly little they can do to influence the nominating process.\n\nPrimary races now tend to be dominated by highly motivated extremists and interest groups, with the perverse result of leaving moderates and broader, less well-organized constituencies underrepresented. According to the Pew Research Center, in the first 12 presidential-primary contests of 2016, only 17 percent of eligible voters participated in Republican primaries, and only 12 percent in Democratic primaries. In other words, Donald Trump seized the lead in the primary process by winning a mere plurality of a mere fraction of the electorate. In off-year congressional primaries, when turnout is even lower, it\u2019s even easier for the tail to wag the dog. In the 2010 Delaware Senate race, Christine \u201cI am not a witch\u201d O\u2019Donnell secured the Republican nomination by winning just a sixth of the state\u2019s registered Republicans, thereby handing a competitive seat to the Democrats. Surveying congressional primaries for a 2014 Brookings Institution report, the journalists Jill Lawrence and Walter Shapiro observed: \u201cThe universe of those who actually cast primary ballots is small and hyper-partisan, and rewards candidates who hew to ideological orthodoxy.\u201d By contrast, party hacks tend to shop for candidates who exert broad appeal in a general election and who will sustain and build the party\u2019s brand, so they generally lean toward relative moderates and team players.\n\nParties, machines, and hacks may not have been pretty, but they did their job\u2014so well that the country forgot why it needed them.\n\nMoreover, recent research by the political scientists Jamie L. Carson and Jason M. Roberts finds that party leaders of yore did a better job of encouraging qualified mainstream candidates to challenge incumbents. \u201cIn congressional districts across the country, party leaders were able to carefully select candidates who would contribute to the collective good of the ticket,\u201d Carson and Roberts write in their 2013 book, Ambition, Competition, and Electoral Reform: The Politics of Congressional Elections Across Time. \u201cThis led to a plentiful supply of quality candidates willing to enter races, since the potential costs of running and losing were largely underwritten by the party organization.\u201d The switch to direct primaries, in which contenders generally self-recruit and succeed or fail on their own account, has produced more oddball and extreme challengers and thereby made general elections less competitive. \u201cA series of reforms that were intended to create more open and less \u2018insider\u2019 dominated elections actually produced more entrenched politicians,\u201d Carson and Roberts write. The paradoxical result is that members of Congress today are simultaneously less responsive to mainstream interests and harder to dislodge.\n\nWas the switch to direct public nomination a net benefit or drawback? The answer to that question is subjective. But one effect is not in doubt: Institutionalists have less power than ever before to protect loyalists who play well with other politicians, or who take a tough congressional vote for the team, or who dare to cross single-issue voters and interests; and they have little capacity to fend off insurgents who owe nothing to anybody. Walled safely inside their gerrymandered districts, incumbents are insulated from general-election challenges that might pull them toward the political center, but they are perpetually vulnerable to primary challenges from extremists who pull them toward the fringes. Everyone worries about being the next Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader who, in a shocking upset, lost to an unknown Tea Partier in his 2014 primary. Legislators are scared of voting for anything that might increase the odds of a primary challenge, which is one reason it is so hard to raise the debt limit or pass a budget.\n\nIn March, when Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas told a Rotary Club meeting that he thought President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee deserved a Senate hearing, the Tea Party Patriots immediately responded with what has become activists\u2019 go-to threat: \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of outrageous behavior that leads Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund activists and supporters to think seriously about encouraging Dr. Milton Wolf\u201d\u2014a physician and Tea Party activist\u2014\u201cto run against Sen. Moran in the August GOP primary.\u201d (Moran hastened to issue a statement saying that he would oppose Obama\u2019s nominee regardless.) Purist issue groups often have the whip hand now, and unlike the elected bosses of yore, they are accountable only to themselves and are able merely to prevent legislative action, not to organize it.\n\nWe reformed political money. Starting in the 1970s, large-dollar donations to candidates and parties were subject to a tightening web of regulations. The idea was to reduce corruption (or its appearance) and curtail the power of special interests\u2014certainly laudable goals. Campaign-finance rules did stop some egregious transactions, but at a cost: Instead of eliminating money from politics (which is impossible), the rules diverted much of it to private channels. Whereas the parties themselves were once largely responsible for raising and spending political money, in their place has arisen a burgeoning ecology of deep-pocketed donors, super pacs, 501(c)(4)s, and so-called 527 groups that now spend hundreds of millions of dollars each cycle. The result has been the creation of an array of private political machines across the country: for instance, the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity and Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads on the right, and Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate on the left.\n\nPrivate groups are much harder to regulate, less transparent, and less accountable than are the parties and candidates, who do, at the end of the day, have to face the voters. Because they thrive on purism, protest, and parochialism, the outside groups are driving politics toward polarization, extremism, and short-term gain. \u201cYou may win or lose, but at least you have been intellectually consistent\u2014your principles haven\u2019t been defeated,\u201d an official with Americans for Prosperity told The Economist in October 2014. The parties, despite being called to judgment by voters for their performance, face all kinds of constraints and regulations that the private groups don\u2019t, tilting the playing field against them. \u201cThe internal conversation we\u2019ve been having is \u2018How do we keep state parties alive?\u2019 \u201d the director of a mountain-state Democratic Party organization told me and Raymond J. La Raja recently for a Brookings Institution report. Republicans told us the same story. \u201cWe believe we are fighting for our lives in the current legal and judicial framework, and the super pacs and (c)(4)s really present a direct threat to the state parties\u2019 existence,\u201d a southern state\u2019s Republican Party director said.\n\nThe state parties also told us they can\u2019t begin to match the advertising money flowing from outside groups and candidates. Weakened by regulations and resource constraints, they have been reduced to spectators, while candidates and groups form circular firing squads and alienate voters. At the national level, the situation is even more chaotic\u2014and ripe for exploitation by a savvy demagogue who can make himself heard above the din, as Donald Trump has so shrewdly proved.\n\nWe reformed Congress. For a long time, seniority ruled on Capitol Hill. To exercise power, you had to wait for years, and chairs ran their committees like fiefs. It was an arrangement that hardly seemed either meritocratic or democratic. Starting with a rebellion by the liberal post-Watergate class in the \u201970s, and then accelerating with the rise of Newt Gingrich and his conservative revolutionaries in the \u201990s, the seniority and committee systems came under attack and withered. Power on the Hill has flowed both up to a few top leaders and down to individual members. Unfortunately, the reformers overlooked something important: Seniority and committee spots rewarded teamwork and loyalty, they ensured that people at the top were experienced, and they harnessed hundreds of middle-ranking members of Congress to the tasks of legislating. Compounding the problem, Gingrich\u2019s Republican revolutionaries, eager to prove their anti-Washington bona fides, cut committee staffs by a third, further diminishing Congress\u2019s institutional horsepower.\n\nSmoke-filled rooms were good for brokering complex compromises in which nothing was settled until everything was settled.\n\nCongress\u2019s attempts to replace hierarchies and middlemen with top-down diktat and ad hoc working groups have mostly failed. More than perhaps ever before, Congress today is a collection of individual entrepreneurs and pressure groups. In the House, disintermediation has shifted the balance of power toward a small but cohesive minority of conservative Freedom Caucus members who think nothing of wielding their power against their own leaders. Last year, as House Republicans struggled to agree on a new speaker, the conservatives did not blush at demanding \u201cthe right to oppose their leaders and vote down legislation without repercussions,\u201d as Time magazine reported. In the Senate, Ted Cruz made himself a leading presidential contender by engaging in debt-limit brinkmanship and deriding the party\u2019s leadership, going so far as to call Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar on the Senate floor. \u201cThe rhetoric\u2014and confrontational stance\u2014are classic Cruz,\u201d wrote Burgess Everett in Politico last October: \u201cStake out a position to the right of where his leaders will end up, criticize them for ignoring him and conservative grass-roots voters, then use the ensuing internecine fight to stoke his presidential bid.\u201d No wonder his colleagues detest him. But Cruz was doing what makes sense in an age of maximal political individualism, and we can safely bet that his success will inspire imitation.\n\nWe reformed closed-door negotiations. As recently as the early 1970s, congressional committees could easily retreat behind closed doors and members could vote on many bills anonymously, with only the final tallies reported. Federal advisory committees, too, could meet off the record. Understandably, in the wake of Watergate, those practices came to be viewed as suspect. Today, federal law, congressional rules, and public expectations have placed almost all formal deliberations and many informal ones in full public view. One result is greater transparency, which is good. But another result is that finding space for delicate negotiations and candid deliberations can be difficult. Smoke-filled rooms, whatever their disadvantages, were good for brokering complex compromises in which nothing was settled until everything was settled; once gone, they turned out to be difficult to replace. In public, interest groups and grandstanding politicians can tear apart a compromise before it is halfway settled.\n\nDespite promising to televise negotiations over health-care reform, President Obama went behind closed doors with interest groups to put the package together; no sane person would have negotiated in full public view. In 2013, Congress succeeded in approving a modest bipartisan budget deal in large measure because the House and Senate Budget Committee chairs were empowered to \u201cfigure it out themselves, very, very privately,\u201d as one Democratic aide told Jill Lawrence for a 2015 Brookings report. TV cameras, recorded votes, and public markups do increase transparency, but they come at the cost of complicating candid conversations. \u201cThe idea that Washington would work better if there were TV cameras monitoring every conversation gets it exactly wrong,\u201d the Democratic former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle wrote in 2014, in his foreword to the book City of Rivals. \u201cThe lack of opportunities for honest dialogue and creative give-and-take lies at the root of today\u2019s dysfunction.\u201d\n\nWe reformed pork. For most of American history, a principal goal of any member of Congress was to bring home bacon for his district. Pork-barrel spending never really cost very much, and it helped glue Congress together by giving members a kind of currency to trade: You support my pork, and I\u2019ll support yours. Also, because pork was dispensed by powerful appropriations committees with input from senior congressional leaders, it provided a handy way for the leadership to buy votes and reward loyalists. Starting in the \u201970s, however, and then snowballing in the \u201990s, the regular appropriations process broke down, a casualty of reforms that weakened appropriators\u2019 power, of \u201csunshine laws\u201d that reduced their autonomy, and of polarization that complicated negotiations. Conservatives and liberals alike attacked pork-barreling as corrupt, culminating in early 2011, when a strange-bedfellows coalition of Tea Partiers and progressives banned earmarking, the practice of dropping goodies into bills as a way to attract votes\u2014including, ironically, votes for politically painful spending reductions.\n\nCongress has not passed all its annual appropriations bills in 20 years, and more than $300 billion a year in federal spending goes out the door without proper authorization. Routine business such as passing a farm bill or a surface-transportation bill now takes years instead of weeks or months to complete. Today two-thirds of federal-program spending (excluding interest on the national debt) runs on formula-driven autopilot. This automatic spending by so-called entitlement programs eludes the discipline of being regularly voted on, dwarfs old-fashioned pork in magnitude, and is so hard to restrain that it\u2019s often called the \u201cthird rail\u201d of politics. The political cost has also been high: Congressional leaders lost one of their last remaining tools to induce followership and team play. \u201cTrying to be a leader where you have no sticks and very few carrots is dang near impossible,\u201d the Republican former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told CNN in 2013, shortly after renegade Republicans pointlessly shut down the government. \u201cMembers don\u2019t get anything from you and leaders don\u2019t give anything. They don\u2019t feel like you can reward them or punish them.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump had no political debts or party loyalty. And he had no compunctions\u2014which made him the perfect vector for anti-establishment sentiment. (John Bazemore / AP)\n\nLike campaign contributions and smoke-filled rooms, pork is a tool of democratic governance, not a violation of it. It can be used for corrupt purposes but also, very often, for vital ones. As the political scientist Diana Evans wrote in a 2004 book, Greasing the Wheels: Using Pork Barrel Projects to Build Majority Coalitions in Congress, \u201cThe irony is this: pork barreling, despite its much maligned status, gets things done.\u201d In 1964, to cite one famous example, Lyndon Johnson could not have passed his landmark civil-rights bill without support from House Republican leader Charles Halleck of Indiana, who named his price: a nasa research grant for his district, which LBJ was glad to provide. Just last year, Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was asked how his committee managed to pass bipartisan authorization bills year after year, even as the rest of Congress ground to a legislative standstill. In part, McCain explained, it was because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot in there for members of the committees.\u201d\n\nParty-dominated nominating processes, soft money, congressional seniority, closed-door negotiations, pork-barrel spending\u2014put each practice under a microscope in isolation, and it seems an unsavory way of doing political business. But sweep them all away, and one finds that business is not getting done at all. The political reforms of the past 40 or so years have pushed toward disintermediation\u2014by favoring amateurs and outsiders over professionals and insiders; by privileging populism and self-expression over mediation and mutual restraint; by stripping middlemen of tools they need to organize the political system. All of the reforms promote an individualistic, atomized model of politics in which there are candidates and there are voters, but there is nothing in between. Other, larger trends, to be sure, have also contributed to political disorganization, but the war on middlemen has amplified and accelerated them.\n\nPathogens\n\nDonald Trump and other viruses\n\nBy the beginning of this decade, the political system\u2019s organic defenses against outsiders and insurgents were visibly crumbling. All that was needed was for the right virus to come along and exploit the opening. As it happened, two came along.\n\nIn 2009, on the heels of President Obama\u2019s election and the economic-bailout packages, angry fiscal conservatives launched the Tea Party insurgency and watched, somewhat to their own astonishment, as it swept the country. Tea Partiers shared some of the policy predilections of loyal Republican partisans, but their mind-set was angrily anti-establishment. In a 2013 Pew Research poll, more than 70 percent of them disapproved of Republican leaders in Congress. In a 2010 Pew poll, they had rejected compromise by similar margins. They thought nothing of mounting primary challenges against Republican incumbents, and they made a special point of targeting Republicans who compromised with Democrats or even with Republican leaders. In Congress, the Republican House leadership soon found itself facing a GOP caucus whose members were too worried about \u201cgetting primaried\u201d to vote for the compromises necessary to govern\u2014or even to keep the government open. Threats from the Tea Party and other purist factions often outweigh any blandishments or protection that leaders can offer.\n\nSo far the Democrats have been mostly spared the anti-compromise insurrection, but their defenses are not much stronger. Molly Ball recently reported for The Atlantic\u2019s Web site on the Working Families Party, whose purpose is \u201cto make Democratic politicians more accountable to their liberal base through the asymmetric warfare party primaries enable, much as the conservative movement has done to Republicans.\u201d Because African Americans and union members still mostly behave like party loyalists, and because the Democratic base does not want to see President Obama fail, the Tea Party trick hasn\u2019t yet worked on the left. But the Democrats are vulnerable structurally, and the anti-compromise virus is out there.\n\nA second virus was initially identified in 2002, by the University of Nebraska at Lincoln political scientists John R. Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse, in their book Stealth Democracy: Americans\u2019 Beliefs About How Government Should Work. It\u2019s a shocking book, one whose implications other scholars were understandably reluctant to engage with. The rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, however, makes confronting its thesis unavoidable.\n\nUsing polls and focus groups, Hibbing and Theiss-Morse found that between 25 and 40 percent of Americans (depending on how one measures) have a severely distorted view of how government and politics are supposed to work. I think of these people as \u201cpolitiphobes,\u201d because they see the contentious give-and-take of politics as unnecessary and distasteful. Specifically, they believe that obvious, commonsense solutions to the country\u2019s problems are out there for the plucking. The reason these obvious solutions are not enacted is that politicians are corrupt, or self-interested, or addicted to unnecessary partisan feuding. Not surprisingly, politiphobes think the obvious, commonsense solutions are the sorts of solutions that they themselves prefer. But the more important point is that they do not acknowledge that meaningful policy disagreement even exists. From that premise, they conclude that all the arguing and partisanship and horse-trading that go on in American politics are entirely unnecessary. Politicians could easily solve all our problems if they would only set aside their craven personal agendas.\n\nIf politicians won\u2019t do the job, then who will? Politiphobes, according to Hibbing and Theiss-Morse, believe policy should be made not by messy political conflict and negotiations but by ensids: empathetic, non-self-interested decision makers. These are leaders who will step forward, cast aside cowardly politicians and venal special interests, and implement long-overdue solutions. ensids can be politicians, technocrats, or autocrats\u2014whatever works. Whether the process is democratic is not particularly important.\n\nChances are that politiphobes have been out there since long before Hibbing and Theiss-Morse identified them in 2002. Unlike the Tea Party or the Working Families Party, they aren\u2019t particularly ideological: They have popped up left, right, and center. Ross Perot\u2019s independent presidential candidacies of 1992 and 1996 appealed to the idea that any sensible businessman could knock heads together and fix Washington. In 2008, Barack Obama pandered to a center-left version of the same fantasy, promising to magically transcend partisan politics and implement the best solutions from both parties.\n\n\u201cPork\u201d can be a vital tool of democratic governance.\n\nNo previous outbreak, however, compares with the latest one, which draws unprecedented virulence from two developments. One is a steep rise in antipolitical sentiment, especially on the right. According to polling by Pew, from 2007 to early 2016 the percentage of Americans saying they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who had been an elected official in Washington for many years than for an outsider candidate more than doubled, from 15 percent to 31 percent. Republican opinion has shifted more sharply still: The percentage of Republicans preferring \u201cnew ideas and a different approach\u201d over \u201cexperience and a proven record\u201d almost doubled in just the six months from March to September of 2015.\n\nThe other development, of course, was Donald Trump, the perfect vector to concentrate politiphobic sentiment, intensify it, and inject it into presidential politics. He had too much money and free media to be spent out of the race. He had no political record to defend. He had no political debts or party loyalty. He had no compunctions. There was nothing to restrain him from sounding every note of the politiphobic fantasy with perfect pitch.\n\nDemocrats have not been immune, either. Like Trump, Bernie Sanders appealed to the antipolitical idea that the mere act of voting for him would prompt a \u201crevolution\u201d that would somehow clear up such knotty problems as health-care coverage, financial reform, and money in politics. Like Trump, he was a self-sufficient outsider without customary political debts or party loyalty. Like Trump, he neither acknowledged nor cared\u2014because his supporters neither acknowledged nor cared\u2014that his plans for governing were delusional.\n\nTrump, Sanders, and Ted Cruz have in common that they are political sociopaths\u2014meaning not that they are crazy, but that they don\u2019t care what other politicians think about their behavior and they don\u2019t need to care. That three of the four final presidential contenders in 2016 were political sociopaths is a sign of how far chaos syndrome has gone. The old, mediated system selected such people out. The new, disintermediated system seems to be selecting them in.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe disorder that exacerbates all other disorders\n\nThere is nothing new about political insurgencies in the United States\u2014nor anything inherently wrong with them. Just the opposite, in fact: Insurgencies have brought fresh ideas and renewed participation to the political system since at least the time of Andrew Jackson.\n\nThere is also nothing new about insiders losing control of the presidential nominating process. In 1964 and 1972, to the dismay of party regulars, nominations went to unelectable candidates\u2014Barry Goldwater for the Republicans in 1964 and George McGovern for the Democrats in 1972\u2014who thrilled the parties\u2019 activist bases and went on to predictably epic defeats. So it\u2019s tempting to say, \u201cDemocracy is messy. Insurgents have fair gripes. Incumbents should be challenged. Who are you, Mr. Establishment, to say the system is broken merely because you don\u2019t like the people it is pushing forward?\u201d\n\nThe problem is not, however, that disruptions happen. The problem is that chaos syndrome wreaks havoc on the system\u2019s ability to absorb and channel disruptions. Trying to quash political disruptions would probably only create more of them. The trick is to be able to govern through them.\n\nLeave aside the fact that Goldwater and McGovern, although ideologues, were estimable figures within their parties. (McGovern actually co-chaired a Democratic Party commission that rewrote the nominating rules after 1968, opening the way for his own campaign.) Neither of them, either as senator or candidate, wanted to or did disrupt the ordinary workings of government.\n\nJason Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and the author of City of Rivals, likes to point out that within three weeks of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment by the House of Representatives, the president was signing new laws again. \u201cWhile they were impeaching him they were negotiating, they were talking, they were having committee hearings,\u201d Grumet said in a recent speech. \u201cAnd so we have to ask ourselves, what is it that not long ago allowed our government to metabolize the aggression that is inherent in any pluralistic society and still get things done?\u201d\n\nI have been covering Washington since the early 1980s, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of gridlock. Sometimes I\u2019ve been grateful for gridlock, which is an appropriate outcome when there is no working majority for a particular policy. For me, however, 2011 brought a wake-up call. The system was failing even when there was a working majority. That year, President Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner, in intense personal negotiations, tried to clinch a budget agreement that touched both parties\u2019 sacred cows, curtailing growth in the major entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security by hundreds of billions of dollars and increasing revenues by $800 billion or more over 10 years, as well as reducing defense and nondefense discretionary spending by more than $1 trillion. Though it was less grand than previous budgetary \u201cgrand bargains,\u201d the package represented the kind of bipartisan accommodation that constitutes the federal government\u2019s best and perhaps only path to long-term fiscal stability.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner explained to Jay Leno before he resigned: \u201cYou learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk.\u201d (Steve Helber / AP)\n\nPeople still debate why the package fell apart, and there is blame enough to go around. My own reading at the time, however, concurred with Matt Bai\u2019s postmortem in The New York Times: Democratic leaders could have found the rank-and-file support they needed to pass the bargain, but Boehner could not get the deal past conservatives in his own caucus. \u201cWhat\u2019s undeniable, despite all the furious efforts to peddle a different story,\u201d Bai wrote, \u201cis that Obama managed to persuade his closest allies to sign off on what he wanted them to do, and Boehner didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t.\u201d We\u2019ll never know, but I believe that the kind of budget compromise Boehner and Obama tried to shake hands on, had it reached a vote, would have passed with solid majorities in both chambers and been signed into law. The problem was not polarization; it was disorganization. A latent majority could not muster and assert itself.\n\nAs soon became apparent, Boehner\u2019s 2011 debacle was not a glitch but part of an emerging pattern. Two years later, the House\u2019s conservative faction shut down the government with the connivance of Ted Cruz, the very last thing most Republicans wanted to happen. When Boehner was asked by Jay Leno why he had permitted what the speaker himself called a \u201cvery predictable disaster,\u201d he replied, rather poignantly: \u201cWhen I looked up, I saw my colleagues going this way. You learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk.\u201d\n\nBoehner was right. Washington doesn\u2019t have a crisis of leadership; it has a crisis of followership. One can argue about particulars, and Congress does better on some occasions than on others. Overall, though, minority factions and veto groups are becoming ever more dominant on Capitol Hill as leaders watch their organizational capacity dribble away. Helpless to do much more than beg for support, and hostage to his own party\u2019s far right, an exhausted Boehner finally gave up and quit last year. Almost immediately, his heir apparent, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, was shot to pieces too. No wonder Paul Ryan, in his first act as speaker, remonstrated with his own colleagues against chaos.\n\nNevertheless, by spring the new speaker was bogged down. \u201cAlmost six months into the job, Ryan and his top lieutenants face questions about whether the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s tenure atop the House is any more effective than his predecessor,\u201d Politico\u2019s Web site reported in April. The House Republican Conference, an unnamed Republican told Politico, is \u201cunwhippable and unleadable. Ryan is as talented as you can be: There\u2019s nobody better. But even he can\u2019t do anything. Who could?\u201d\n\nOf course, Congress\u2019s incompetence makes the electorate even more disgusted, which leads to even greater political volatility. In a Republican presidential debate in March, Ohio Governor John Kasich described the cycle this way: The people, he said, \u201cwant change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change. Then the change doesn\u2019t come \u2026 because we\u2019re putting people in that don\u2019t understand compromise.\u201d Disruption in politics and dysfunction in government reinforce each other. Chaos becomes the new normal.\n\nBeing a disorder of the immune system, chaos syndrome magnifies other problems, turning political head colds into pneumonia. Take polarization. Over the past few decades, the public has become sharply divided across partisan and ideological lines. Chaos syndrome compounds the problem, because even when Republicans and Democrats do find something to work together on, the threat of an extremist primary challenge funded by a flood of outside money makes them think twice\u2014or not at all. Opportunities to make bipartisan legislative advances slip away.\n\nNeurotic hatred of the political class is the country\u2019s last universally acceptable form of bigotry.\n\nOr take the new technologies that are revolutionizing the media. Today, a figure like Trump can reach millions through Twitter without needing to pass network\u2011TV gatekeepers or spend a dime. A figure like Sanders can use the Internet to reach millions of donors without recourse to traditional fund-raising sources. Outside groups, friendly and unfriendly alike, can drown out political candidates in their own races. (As a frustrated Cruz told a supporter about outside groups ostensibly backing his presidential campaign, \u201cI\u2019m left to just hope that what they say bears some resemblance to what I actually believe.\u201d) Disruptive media technologies are nothing new in American politics; they have arisen periodically since the early 19th century, as the historian Jill Lepore noted in a February article in The New Yorker. What is new is the system\u2019s difficulty in coping with them. Disintermediating technologies bring fresh voices into the fray, but they also bring atomization and cacophony. To organize coherent plays amid swarms of attack ads, middlemen need to be able to coordinate the fund-raising and messaging of candidates and parties and activists\u2014which is what they are increasingly hard-pressed to do.\n\nAssembling power to govern a sprawling, diverse, and increasingly divided democracy is inevitably hard. Chaos syndrome makes it all the harder. For Democrats, the disorder is merely chronic; for the Republican Party, it is acute. Finding no precedent for what he called Trump\u2019s hijacking of an entire political party, Jon Meacham went so far as to tell Joe Scarborough in The Washington Post that George W. Bush might prove to be the last Republican president.\n\nNearly everyone panned party regulars for not stopping Trump much earlier, but no one explained just how the party regulars were supposed to have done that. Stopping an insurgency requires organizing a coalition against it, but an incapacity to organize is the whole problem. The reality is that the levers and buttons parties and political professionals might once have pulled and pushed had long since been disconnected.\n\nPrognosis and Treatment\n\nChaos syndrome as a psychiatric disorder\n\nI don\u2019t have a quick solution to the current mess, but I do think it would be easy, in principle, to start moving in a better direction. Although returning parties and middlemen to anything like their 19th-century glory is not conceivable\u2014or, in today\u2019s America, even desirable\u2014strengthening parties and middlemen is very doable. Restrictions inhibiting the parties from coordinating with their own candidates serve to encourage political wildcatting, so repeal them. Limits on donations to the parties drive money to unaccountable outsiders, so lift them. Restoring the earmarks that help grease legislative success requires nothing more than a change in congressional rules. And there are all kinds of ways the parties could move insiders back to the center of the nomination process. If they wanted to, they could require would-be candidates to get petition signatures from elected officials and county party chairs, or they could send unbound delegates to their conventions (as several state parties are doing this year), or they could enhance the role of middlemen in a host of other ways.\n\nBuilding party machines and political networks is what career politicians naturally do, if they\u2019re allowed to do it. So let them. I\u2019m not talking about rigging the system to exclude challengers or prevent insurgencies. I\u2019m talking about de-rigging the system to reduce its pervasive bias against middlemen. Then they can do their job, thereby making the world safe for challengers and insurgencies.\n\nUnfortunately, although the mechanics of de-rigging are fairly straightforward, the politics of it are hard. The public is wedded to an anti-establishment narrative. The political-reform community is invested in direct participation, transparency, fund-raising limits on parties, and other elements of the anti-intermediation worldview. The establishment, to the extent that there still is such a thing, is demoralized and shattered, barely able to muster an argument for its own existence.\n\nBut there are optimistic signs, too. Liberals in the campaign-finance-reform community are showing new interest in strengthening the parties. Academics and commentators are getting a good look at politics without effective organizers and cohesive organizations, and they are terrified. On Capitol Hill, conservatives and liberals alike are on board with restoring regular order in Congress. In Washington, insiders have had some success at reorganizing and pushing back. No Senate Republican was defeated by a primary challenger in 2014, in part because then\u2013Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a machine politician par excellence, created a network of business allies to counterpunch against the Tea Party.\n\nThe biggest obstacle, I think, is the general public\u2019s reflexive, unreasoning hostility to politicians and the process of politics. Neurotic hatred of the political class is the country\u2019s last universally acceptable form of bigotry. Because that problem is mental, not mechanical, it really is hard to remedy.\n\nIn March, a Trump supporter told The New York Times, \u201cI want to see Trump go up there and do damage to the Republican Party.\u201d Another said, \u201cWe know who Donald Trump is, and we\u2019re going to use Donald Trump to either take over the G.O.P. or blow it up.\u201d That kind of anti-establishment nihilism deserves no respect or accommodation in American public life. Populism, individualism, and a skeptical attitude toward politics are all healthy up to a point, but America has passed that point. Political professionals and parties have many shortcomings to answer for\u2014including, primarily on the Republican side, their self-mutilating embrace of anti-establishment rhetoric\u2014but relentlessly bashing them is no solution. You haven\u2019t heard anyone say this, but it\u2019s time someone did: Our most pressing political problem today is that the country abandoned the establishment, not the other way around.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/"}, "article3": {"title": "A surprising number of Americans dislike how messy democracy is. They like Trump.", "content": "Gift Article Share\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2013 or more to the point, his substantial and sustained public support \u2014 has surprised almost every observer of American politics. Social scientists and pundits note that Trump appeals to populists, nativists, ethnocentrists, anti-intellectuals and authoritarians, not to mention angry and disaffected white males with little education.\n\nBut few have noticed another side of Trump\u2019s supporters. A surprising number of Americans feel dismissive about such core features of democratic government as deliberation, compromise and decision-making by elected, accountable officials. They believe that governing is (or should be) simple, and best undertaken by a few smart, capable people who are not overtly self-interested and can solve challenging issues without boring discussions and unsatisfying compromises.\n\nBecause that\u2019s just what Trump promises, his candidacy is attracting those who think someone should just walk in and get it done. His message is that our country\u2019s problems are straightforward. All we need is to get \u201cgreat people, really great people\u201d to solve them. No muss, no fuss, no need to hear or take seriously opposing viewpoints. Trump\u2019s straight-talking, unfiltered, shoot-from-the-hip style promises a leader who will take action \u2013 instead of working toward a consensus among competing interests. That sounds perfect to the millions of Americans who are just as impatient with standard democratic procedures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany voters don\u2019t like democracy\u2019s messiness\n\nMany Americans don\u2019t appreciate that democracy is unavoidably messy in a remarkably heterogeneous society, as we showed 15 years ago in our book \u201cStealth Democracy.\u201d We based that book on a random-sample survey of 1,266 Americans administered by Gallup in 1998. We found that:\n\n86 percent of respondents believed that \u201celected officials would help the country more if they would stop talking and just take action.\u201d\n\n60 percent agreed that \u201ccompromise is really just selling out on one\u2019s principles.\u201d\n\n60 percent believed that \u201cgovernment would work best if it were run like a business.\u201d\n\n32 percent were convinced that the U.S. government would \u201crun better if decisions were left up to successful business people.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, 31 percent believed it would run better if those decisions were instead left to \u201cnon-elected experts.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists know that democratic governance by its nature demands debate and compromise and is not remotely like \u201ca business.\u201d But we learned 15 years ago that many Americans disagreed, and nearly a third of American adults believed government would run better without elected officials. The anti-politics candidate (and businessman) H. Ross Perot tapped into this sentiment and got nearly 20 million votes in 1992.\n\nNor has American support for democratic processes grown in the past 15 years. In early 2016, political scientists David Fortunato and Matthew Hibbing posed a few of the same items to a nationally representative sample. They found that 29 percent of Americans think it would be better to leave political decisions to non-elected experts; 26 percent think it would be better to leave political decisions to successful business people. That\u2019s only a little less support than we found 15 years ago \u2013 and it\u2019s about the same proportion of the electorate that likes Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nWe surveyed Americans again in the fall of 2015, using Prolific Academic, a crowdsourcing platform similar to Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. All 908 respondents were American citizens from across the United States and were paid for taking the survey. We asked whether people agreed that compromise is just selling out on principles; whether politicians should stop talking and just take action; and whether political decisions should be left up to business people or unelected experts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe label those who agreed with these items as \u201cstealth democrats,\u201d a term we use not to refer to secret supporters of the Democratic Party, but rather people with only the loosest of commitments to core features of democratic governance. And once again, we found similar percentages of stealth democrats compared to our earlier survey: Fifteen years ago, 27 percent of people agreed with all of the items; six months ago, 24 percent did.\n\nThose Americans like Trump\n\nAre supporters of stealth democracy also attracted to Trump? In last fall\u2019s survey, we asked respondents to report how warmly or coolly they felt toward several presidential candidates in the race at the time. Feeling thermometers range from 0 to 100, with 0 for cold or negative feelings toward the candidate and 100 for warm or positive feelings. We left out the question about whether to have successful business people (as many people view Trump) make political decisions \u2013 because that might have \u201cprimed\u201d our respondents to rate Trump favorably. In the stealth democracy measure, someone with a zero doesn\u2019t agree with any of our statements above; someone with a three agrees with all of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow you can see the average feeling thermometer score for four of the candidates we asked about in the survey \u2014 first for those individuals who disagreed with all the stealth democracy positions, and then for those individuals who supported all three.\n\nFeelings toward Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were largely unaffected by attitudes toward democratic processes, and feelings toward Carly Fiorina were affected a little.\n\nBut here\u2019s the big news: Stealth democrats felt fully 25 degrees warmer toward Trump than those who believe in debate, compromise and elected officials making public decisions. We assume that\u2019s because the stealth democrats like his promises to make things happen.\n\nDo Democrats and independents like Trump\u2019s anti-politics approach? Our 2015 survey results offer a hint. The figure below breaks down attitudes toward democratic processes and feelings toward Trump within each party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s good news for Trump: stealth democrats who are Democrats and, even more so, independents like him much more than their fellow partisans who believe in democracy\u2019s messiness. The emotional gap between the \u201cmessy democrats\u201d (with a zero) and the \u201cstealth democrats\u201d (with a three) was seven degrees among Republicans, 13 degrees among Democrats and 24 degrees among independents.\n\nBut here\u2019s the bad news for Trump: Far fewer Democrats and independents are stealth democrats. In fact, only 16 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of independents are \u2014 compared with 40 percent of Republicans.\n\nAs we try to understand Trump\u2019s success, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s more to the story than just uneducated, authoritarian, misogynist, angry, old racists. He also gets his support from the quarter of the American electorate who believe that governing is so easy that it shouldn\u2019t be bogged down by discussion, compromise and understanding various points of view \u2013 or maybe even voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn R.
