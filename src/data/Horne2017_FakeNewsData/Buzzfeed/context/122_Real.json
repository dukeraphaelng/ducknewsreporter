But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate \u2014 our choice, Hillary Clinton \u2014 has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. (We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history.)\n\nBut this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. We\u2019re aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken.\n\nRunning down the other guy won\u2019t suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn\u2019t Donald Trump.\n\nThe best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s capacity to rise to them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-for-president.html"}, "article2": {"title": "\u2018I just knew I wasn\u2019t going to help\u2019: Taylor Swift finally explains why she didn\u2019t endorse Hillary Clinton", "content": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nWhen Taylor Swift declined to endorse a candidate in the 2016 election \u2014 posting only a cryptic picture of herself standing in line at a polling station with an encouragement to her followers to \u201cGo out and VOTE\u201d \u2014 theories about her silence abounded. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Some suspected that the pop star didn\u2019t want to anger conservative country music listeners, who still made up a considerable portion of her fan base, by coming out as a liberal. Others interpreted her refusal to denounce Donald Trump as proof that she supported him, and she was venerated by members of the alt-right. Meanwhile, \u201cWho is Taylor Swift voting for?\u201d became one of the top searches on Google, and fans painstakingly scoured the singer\u2019s Instagram for clues. Some even theorized the cutout sweater Swift wore to the polls could be subtly referencing a shoulderless dress that Hillary Clinton wore in 1993.\n\nNow, in a new interview with Vogue that appeared online Thursday and will run in the magazine\u2019s September issue, the singer has finally broken her silence and explained why she refrained from endorsing Clinton, even as she was pilloried for her neutrality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision was strategic, Swift said: She felt that adding her name to the list of high-profile Clinton-backing pop stars like Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, Rihanna and Lady Gaga could backfire given that Trump was positioning himself as a candidate who spoke for regular people, not celebrity elites.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately in the 2016 election you had a political opponent who was weaponizing the idea of the celebrity endorsement.\u201d Swift told writer Abby Aguirre. \u201cHe was going around saying, \u2018I\u2019m a man of the people. I\u2019m for you. I care about you.\u2019 I just knew I wasn\u2019t going to help.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift endorsed two Tennessee Democrats before the 2018 midterm elections, breaking her long silence on political subjects. Here's why she spoke up. (Video: Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nSwift also noted that she and Clinton have something in common: Their critics have accused them of being calculating and dishonest.\n\nIn the months before the 2016 election, Swift reached the low point of her popularity after she slammed Kanye West for making derogatory references to her on his song \u201cFamous\u201d and was accused of being a \u201csnake\u201d by West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian, who posted videos showing that the singer had approved the lyric, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.\u201d (Swift has maintained that she wasn\u2019t told about the line that follows \u2014 \u201cI made that b---- famous.\u201d) One consequence of the backlash was that Swift worried her endorsement would do more harm than good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe summer before that election, all people were saying was, \u2018She\u2019s calculated. She\u2019s manipulative. She\u2019s not what she seems. She\u2019s a snake. She\u2019s a liar,'\u201d the pop star told Vogue. \u201cThese are the same exact insults people were hurling at Hillary. Would I be an endorsement or would I be a liability?\"\n\nShe described how the attacks might have gone: \"'Look, snakes of a feather flock together. Look, the two lying women. The two nasty women.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough political analysts have since questioned whether having a star-studded lineup of celebrity endorsements contributed to Clinton\u2019s defeat, rather than helping her, Swift\u2019s refusal to take a side led to widespread backlash in the run-up to the 2016 election and only intensified after Trump was elected.\n\nA Guardian editorial deemed the singer \u201ca musical envoy for the president\u2019s values\u201d on account of her silence, while other writers accused her being complicit in racism and sexism. Though Swift expressed support for the inaugural Women\u2019s March in 2017, she was derided for not attending.\n\nSwift had previously hinted that she held liberal views \u2014 in 2009, she told Rolling Stone that she supported President Barack Obama. But her pointed refusal to discuss politics in the years that followed, coupled with the nostalgic themes of her early music, allowed some far-right commentators to speculate that she was secretly conservative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October, a month before the 2018 midterms, that illusion was destroyed: Swift, who has a home in Nashville, announced that she planned on voting for two Tennessee Democrats, Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper, who were running for the Senate and House, respectively, and expressed her support for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cIn the past I\u2019ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post that received more than 2 million likes. \u201cI always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.\u201d\n\nThe response highlighted Swift\u2019s political influence \u2014 and its limits. On Instagram, Swift name-checked Vote.org, and within 24 hours, some 65,000 people headed to the site and registered to vote. It was impossible to say exactly how many of those new registrations could be directly attributed to Swift, but the data showed that the largest surge had come from the 18-to-24 demographic, matching her fan base. And though Cooper won reelection, Bredesen lost to Republican Marsha Blackburn, whom Swift had slammed in her post. (President Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that Swift \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything\u201d about Blackburn and he liked the singer\u2019s music \u201cabout 25 percent less now.\u201d)\n\nIn recent months, Swift has thrown her weight behind LGBTQ issues, and lobbied to amend the Civil Rights Act to include provisions that would bar discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. (She\u2019s also been accused of appropriating gay culture in her latest music video.) Speaking with Vogue, she explained that she decided she needed to be more vocal about her views a year or two ago, when friend and singer-songwriter Todrick Hall asked her, \u201cWhat would you do if your son was gay?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that he had to ask, Swift told the magazine, \u201cshocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough.\u201d To her, it was obvious that having a gay child wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\n\u201cIf he was thinking that, I can\u2019t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,\u201d Swift said. \u201cIt was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn\u2019t been publicly clear about that.\u201d\n\nThough Swift didn\u2019t indicate in the interview if she has a preferred Democratic candidate for 2020, she wrote in March that she wants to be more engaged in politics going forward.\n\n\u201cWe have a big race coming up next year,\u201d she noted.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/taylor-swift-hillary-clinton-trump-vogue-interview/"}, "article3": {"title": "Clinton blasts Trump for 'casual inciting of violence,' Republicans shaken", "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Republican opponent Donald Trump of inciting violence with his call for gun rights activists to stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments added to a growing outcry over Trump\u2019s remarks on Tuesday at a North Carolina rally, which some interpreted as a call for violence against his White House rival. His remarks also fueled widespread concerns about his ability to stay on track.\n\n\u201cWords matter, my friends,\u201d the former U.S. secretary of state, who rarely engages in direct back-and-forths with her Republican rival, said at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cAnd if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line,\u201d she said, citing \u201chis casual inciting of violence.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted in an interview with Fox News that his remarks were a call for political, not physical, action.\n\n\u201cThere is tremendous political power to save the Second Amendment, tremendous,\u201d the New York businessman said. \u201cAnd you look at the power they have in terms of votes and that\u2019s what I was referring to, obviously that\u2019s what I was referring to, and everybody knows it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything remotely comparable to it. No one tells a joke about the opponent getting shot. I\u2019ve never heard it,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a top aide for Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign in 2000 and John Kerry\u2019s in 2004.\n\nREPUBLICANS SHAKEN\n\nHigh-profile Republicans and rank-and-file voters appeared shaken on Wednesday after a string of Trump misfires, struggling with how to best reject his divisive candidacy. Some pledged to withhold their endorsement and others backed Clinton.\n\nSome, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, called for party leaders to replace Trump on the ticket.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 5-8 - before Trump\u2019s latest controversy - showed that nearly one-fifth of 396 registered Republicans said they want Trump to drop out of the race and another 10 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d whether the Republican nominee should or not.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign, seeing an opening, has moved to bring disenchanted Republicans into the fold by announcing an official intraparty outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic nominee.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign now has a website for Republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support, listing 50 prominent Republicans and independents who have endorsed her.\n\nOn Monday, 50 Republican national security officials signed an open letter questioning Trump\u2019s temperament, calling him reckless and unqualified to be president.\n\nOther top Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine this week, have disavowed Trump but said they cannot back Clinton.\n\nJames Rohrscheib, 74, a registered Republican and retired U.S. Navy officer from Washington state, told Reuters the reality is the Nov. 8 election will be a \u201ctough one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a quandary as to who I am going to vote for,\u201d Rohrscheib said.\n\nTrump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so-called Washington elite to his drive to change the status quo.\n\nOne group that appears unswayed is Trump\u2019s donors. Reuters interviewed nine major Trump donors on Wednesday, and not one said his Second Amendment comment had given them pause.\n\nTrump Texas fundraising co-chair Gaylord Hughey called the interpretation of his remark as condoning violence \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another issue the press has really twisted to make headlines,\u201d Hughey said.\n\nBut Mike Smith, a Republican voter and Reuters/Ipsos poll respondent, said the support Trump is still receiving from Republicans \u201calmost seems obligatory rather than voluntary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost at the point where I think I\u2019m going to vote for Hillary. I don\u2019t like her,\u201d said Smith, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Clearwater, Florida. \u201cBut Mr. Trump is making me very nervous.\u201d\n\nRESET ABANDONED\n\nRepublican strategist and Trump supporter Ford O\u2019Connell said Trump has \u201cdug himself a deep hole\u201d with voters and to win the election he will need to \u201cmake it a referendum on Hillary Clinton and the \u2018rigged system.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump sought to do just that by using an economic policy speech in Detroit on Monday to correct a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier. But his remarks Tuesday undermined that effort.\n\n\u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,\u201d Trump said at the rally in North Carolina. \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he continued.\n\nA federal official familiar with the matter denied a media report that the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates threats against presidents and candidates, had formally spoken with the Trump campaign about his remark.\n\nTrump\u2019s comment and the resulting backlash occurred as Reuters/Ipsos polling showed some 44 percent of 1,162 registered voters believe Trump should exit the race, and that as of Tuesday, Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points, up from a 3-point lead late last week.\n\nStrategists and Trump detractors agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove Trump from the Republican ticket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wishful thinking to believe the Republicans are going to replace its nominee after the convention. People are grasping at straws,\u201d Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist unaffiliated with Trump, told Reuters.\n\nA more likely scenario would be a replay of the 1996 presidential race, when the Republican Party essentially deserted nominee Bob Dole, who was badly trailing President Bill Clinton, to focus on congressional races.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN10L1JT"}}
