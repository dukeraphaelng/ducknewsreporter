REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey said his assumption that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 presidential election was a factor in opening an inquiry into her emails, according to part of an ABC interview broadcast on Saturday.\n\nThe controversy involved Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for official correspondence when she was secretary of state under then-President Barack Obama, including for messages that were later determined to contain classified information.\n\nAlthough the FBI ultimately decided not to refer Clinton\u2019s case for prosecution, Democrats said Comey\u2019s announcement damaged her with voters right before the election, and he faced complaints that his moves were politically motivated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember consciously thinking about that, but it must have been because I was operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump, and so I\u2019m sure that it was a factor,\u201d Comey said in an excerpt of an interview aired on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember spelling it out, but it had to have been, that she\u2019s going to be elected president and if I hide this from the American people, she\u2019ll be illegitimate the moment she\u2019s elected, the moment this comes out,\u201d Comey added.\n\nComey, who was fired by Republican President Donald Trump last May, is doing a series of media interviews that coincide with the release next week of his book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership.\u201d\n\nTrump, who criticized Comey repeatedly before and after he fired him, denounced him on Twitter on Friday: \u201cJames Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR,\u201d he said.
