Because frankly, that\u2019s the way I feel. Can you imagine these people, these animals, over in the Middle East that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we\u2019re having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.\u201d\n\nRead More: President Trump\u2019s Illegal Military Orders\n\nWhen Trump then went on to defend his assertion that the United States should target the families of terrorists, he repeated a debunked conspiracy theory about the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\n\u201cWhen a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center and his family gets sent back to where they were going\u2026 They knew what was happening.

In fact, virtually all of the hijackers were unmarried.

Trump\u2019s presidency, if recent history is any guide, intelligence officials will meet to discuss a terrorism suspect living abroad. This suspect might become the next target for the nation\u2019s not-so-secret drone force. Or maybe, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers could decide, he is worth trying to capture.\n\nUnder President Obama, security officials have followed a familiar script once they have taken someone into custody. They ask an allied country to conduct the interrogation, or instead question the suspect aboard an American warship using military interrogation techniques, then turn him over to the Justice Department for prosecution in a civilian court inside the United States.\n\nMr. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back waterboarding, a banned method previously used by C.I.A. interrogators, and allow unspecified practices he called \u201ca hell of a lot worse.\u201d The president-elect said in an interview last week that he had heard compelling arguments that torture was not effective, though it is not clear whether he intends to retreat from his position.\n\nIf he moves ahead to fulfill his campaign pledge, it will not be easy. Federal law, international pressure and resistance from inside the C.I.A. stand in his way. Even if he overcomes those obstacles, the toll of America\u2019s agonizing treatment of captives has left a legacy of harm that will make it harder for Trump administration lawyers to justify resuming use of the tactics.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/politics/trump-waterboarding-torture.html"}, "article3": {"title": "Trump says \u2018torture works,\u2019 backs waterboarding and \u2018much worse\u2019", "content": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nDonald Trump went even further in his support of waterboarding and other barred interrogation techniques Wednesday, saying that as president he would use torture in the fight against terrorism. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 torture works,\u201d Trump said during a campaign event at a retirement community here Wednesday morning. \u201cHalf these guys [say]: \u2018Torture doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 Believe me, it works.\u201d\n\nMost Republican candidates for president approve of the use of waterboarding in extreme cases, calling it a valuable enhanced interrogation technique that is not torture, which is forbidden under U.S. and international law.\n\nBut in an election year in which many conservative voters are deathly afraid of Islamic State terrorists, Trump is setting himself apart by promising not just to fight terrorists but also to torture them and kill their loved ones \u2014 and to treat all foreign Muslims as suspects by barring them from entry to the United States.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re chopping off our heads in the Middle East,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cThey want to kill us, they want to kill us. They want to kill our country. They want to knock out our cities.\u201d\n\nWith his comments, Trump has reignited debate over extreme interrogation measures that the CIA embraced after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks but discontinued more than a decade ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaterboarding involves restraining prisoners on their backs with their feet higher than their heads, then covering their faces and pouring water into their mouths and noses, making them feel as though they are drowning.\n\nAlthough the CIA held more than 100 prisoners in its secret overseas prisons, only three are known to have been subjected to waterboarding. Among them was Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, who was waterboarded 183 times before the agency abandoned the practice amid concerns that its legal footing was slipping.\n\nFor months, Trump has repeatedly called for the use of waterboarding and other unidentified techniques that are even more severe. Up until Wednesday, Trump had stopped short of calling such techniques torture, although his comments seemed to show him openly embracing the idea of torturing people who are at odds with the United States. Trump\u2019s campaign manager and spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late November, Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, that he would approve the use of waterboarding \"in a heartbeat\" because \"only a stupid person would say it doesn't work.\"\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey deserve it anyway, for what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s call for waterboarding and more extreme measures is always met with warm applause and cheers at his rallies \u2014 forcing his opponents into a tricky position. The traditional GOP response has been that torture is wrong but that waterboarding is not torture. How do they deal with a rival who embraces waterboarding as being torture and calls for its use?\n\nEven the staunchest defenders of the CIA program have stopped far short of Trump\u2019s position. In books and television appearances, CIA veterans have maintained that the agency\u2019s methods were legally approved by the Justice Department and never constituted torture. But no prominent former CIA executive has argued that the program should be reinstated, and many believe that even if a future president were to order a resumption of waterboarding or other brutal measures, agency operatives would almost certainly refuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CIA has maintained that it got valuable intelligence from the program, but it came at a considerable price. Agency operatives remained under a cloud of criminal and congressional investigations for years. A multi-year Senate probe completed in 2014 found that even CIA insiders were at times deeply disturbed by what they witnessed.\n\nCIA medical personnel warned that waterboarding sessions often described to policymakers as a carefully administered procedure had deteriorated to a \u201cseries of near drownings.\u201d In 2002, agency employees at a secret prison in Thailand broke down emotionally after watching harrowing interrogations of al-Qaeda suspect Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, better known as Abu Zubaida, \u201csome to the point of tears and choking up.\u201d\n\nObama banned CIA enhanced interrogations within days of taking office in 2009. Since then, terrorism suspects captured overseas have been questioned by a team including FBI and CIA representatives who are supposed to abide by strict U.S. military interrogation guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire, former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 whose brother authorized waterboarding \u2014 said that it was \u201cused sparingly\u201d and that he would not take action to revive it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said waterboarding \u201cdoes not meet the generally recognized definition of torture\u201d but that he \u201cwould not bring it back in any sort of widespread use.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) seemed to avoid answering the question by saying that U.S. officials \u201cshould not be discussing in a widespread way the exact tactics that we\u2019re going to use because that allows terrorists to know to practice how to evade us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the same event, Trump pledged to \u201cbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\u201d\n\nThe morning after the debate, ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump whether he \u201cwould authorize torture.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cI would absolutely authorize something beyond waterboarding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who was tortured as a prisoner during the Vietnam War \u2014 said that \u201cwaterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques\u201d did not prevent further attacks on the country and \u201ccompromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, however, Trump mocked Cruz for not taking a stronger stance on waterboarding. As he spoke at a rally, a woman in the audience called Cruz \u201ca pussy\u201d \u2014 an insult that Trump repeated to the crowd.\n\nWaterboarding came up again Wednesday when South Carolina state Rep. Bill Herbkersman (R) asked Trump a series of questions in a fireside-chat-style event that lasted 33 minutes.\n\n\u201cOn that whole thing of politically correct, would you allow U.S. interrogators to waterboard terrorist prisoners in order to extract information?\u201d Herbkersman asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Trump said to strong applause from the audience of about 500 retirees, who often laughed as Trump discussed the issue.\n\nOn Cruz, Trump said that \u201che didn\u2019t want to get involved because he thought waterboarding was bad, so \u2014 of course it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s not chopping off heads, folks. Okay? That I can tell you.\u201d\n\nTrump said that he would \u201cimmediately\u201d resume waterboarding and other techniques that are \u201cmuch worse\u201d because the United States is facing a barbaric enemy. He called waterboarding a \u201cminor form\u201d of interrogation.\n\n\u201cSome people say it\u2019s not actually torture \u2014 let\u2019s assume it is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut they asked me the question: \u2018What are you going to do on waterboarding?\u2019 Absolutely fine, but we should go much stronger than waterboarding. That\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d\n\nGreg Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-torture-works-backs-waterboarding-and-much-worse/2016/02/17/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html"}}
