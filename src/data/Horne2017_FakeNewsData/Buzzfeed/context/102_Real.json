A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls \u2014 Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals.\n\nBut when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something I\u2019ve never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a disruption.\u201d\n\nRoy isn\u2019t happy about this: He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.\n\n\u201cUntil the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country,\u201d he told me.\n\nThis is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.\n\nHis history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken,\u201d Roy tells me. \u201cTrump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.\u201d\n\nThe conservative movement\u2019s founding error: Barry Goldwater\n\nThe conservative movement has something of a founding myth \u2014 Roy calls it an \u201corigin story.\u201d\n\nIn 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckley\u2019s ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.\n\nNormally, Goldwater\u2019s defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, it\u2019s the first act of a tragedy.\n\n\u201cGoldwater\u2019s nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement,\u201d Roy tells me, \u201cbecause for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism\u201d\n\nGoldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He himself was not especially racist \u2014 he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this \u201cprincipled\u201d stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyone\u2019s eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.\n\nThis had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans,\u201d Roy says. \u201cConservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem.\u201d\n\nConservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP \u2014 hence Trump\n\nThe available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that 1964 really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes.\n\nYet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was \u201cpopular but indefensible.\u201d\n\nThis revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their party\u2019s voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.\n\n\u201cConservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble,\u201d Roy says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism \u2014 philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.\u201d\n\nConservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isn\u2019t racist.\n\nSo they deny the party\u2019s racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats\u2019 embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we\u2019ve inherited,\u201d Roy says.\n\nHe expands on this idea: \u201cIt\u2019s a common observation on the left, but it\u2019s an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn\u2019t true \u2014 which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.\u201d\n\nThis, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump\u2019s rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwater\u2019s victory was a triumph.\n\nBut in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trump\u2019s politics of aggrieved white nationalism \u2014 labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists \u2014 succeeded because the party\u2019s voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.\n\n\u201c[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement \u2014 but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Roy concludes, glumly.\n\nFor conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die\n\nOver beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad.\n\n\u201cWhen Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe it\u2019s cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things I\u2019ve been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nThis soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.\n\nBoth are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isn\u2019t a winning formula in a nation that\u2019s increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.\n\n\u201cEither the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge, \u00e0 la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s],\u201d Roy says.\n\nThe work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism \u2014 a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important to take stock,\u201d he says, \u201cand build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how this would work. I don\u2019t think Roy knows either.\n\nFor the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. That\u2019s Roy\u2019s own diagnosis, and I think it\u2019s correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.\n\nI\u2019ve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.\n\nBut not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy\u2019s \u201ccranky old white people\u201d \u2014 and they\u2019re dying off.\n\nMaybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right-of-center party.\n\nBecause we now know what the alternative looks like. It\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nWatch: How the Republican Party went from Lincoln to Trump", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12256510/republican-party-trump-avik-roy"}, "article2": {"title": "Saving Conservatism From Trump's GOP", "content": "Avik Roy, disaffected Republican, surveyed the upstairs room of a tony Palo Alto restaurant where a group of journalists and conservative intellectuals was sipping cocktails before a private dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s like that scene in Titanic,\u201d he remarked to me, \u201cwhere they know the ship is going down, and the conductor decides there\u2019s nothing to do but keep the orchestra playing.\u201d\n\nIn an alternate universe, Roy, who is 43 and whose first name is pronounced \u201cOh-vick,\u201d might be spending his autumn pushing policy papers as an adviser to Republican presidential nominee Marco Rubio. The dinner we were attending\u2014the prelude to a policy seminar at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution\u2014might be teeming with excitement about the intellectual possibilities of a Rubio administration. Roy, a health-care expert who has advised Rubio, Rick Perry, and Mitt Romney, once looked forward to 2016 as a year of Republican opportunity, when the party would choose a leader capable of reorienting it toward the future.\n\nBut in the real world, Donald Trump was running on a platform directly opposed to the pro-trade, pro-immigration, pro-small-government ideology of conservatives like Roy. Many of those at the Hoover gathering, Roy included, feared they would not have a party to come back to post-Trump. They are among a class of conservative operatives, thinkers, and staffers who have spent the campaign season adrift, pondering the causes of their party\u2019s disruption and looking nervously to the future. Fifty Republican national-security experts signed an open letter declaring Trump a danger to the republic; several staffers quit the Republican National Committee rather than work to elect Trump. Allegiances have been sundered, and professional trajectories thrown into confusion. One former top RNC staffer told me he no longer speaks to his once-close colleagues; a conservative policy expert who runs a think tank in Washington, D.C., says he\u2019s become adept at steering conversations away from politics and toward college football. Several Republicans I know, finding the campaign intolerable, have rediscovered old hobbies.\n\nExplore the November 2016 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nOf the various explanations that have been advanced in such quarters to explain Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP, Roy\u2019s may be the most explosive. Although he was originally drawn to the party for its emphasis on economic freedom and self-reliance, he now believes that a substantial portion of Republicans were never motivated by those ideas. Rather than a conservative party that happens to incorporate cultural grievances, today\u2019s GOP is, in his view, a vehicle for the racial resentment, nationalism, and nostalgia of older white voters. The element of the party that he once dismissed as a fringe, in other words, now seems to form its core.\n\n\u201cTrump showed me that white identity politics was the dominant force driving the Republican grass roots,\u201d Roy told me when we met a couple of days later at a coffeehouse and co-working space in Palo Alto. Young women with adventurously colored hair pecked away on laptops; youths of South and East Asian descent streamed by our table, sporting giant headphones. Roy, who has a round face and a serious manner, wore a long-sleeved dark-blue Izod polo, his tortoiseshell sunglasses hanging from the collar.\n\nOver a mug of skim-milk cappuccino, Roy explained that, while many fellow partisans still see Trump as an anomaly, he now believes Trump is the \u201clogical end point\u201d of the GOP\u2019s long history of racialized politics. \u201cBarry Goldwater was wrong to oppose the Civil Rights Act in 1964,\u201d Roy told me. While the Arizona senator personally supported racial equality, he opposed the landmark legislation on constitutional grounds. His selection as the GOP nominee that year set off a slow-motion realignment of the parties, as the Democrats\u2014once the party of southern segregation\u2014became the party of minority rights, while the Republicans became dominant in the South. For a time, attracting white voters was a winning national strategy for the GOP. But today, Roy believes, the party finds itself not just electorally deficient but morally compromised. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t going to confront that history as conservatives and Republicans,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t deserve minority votes.\u201d\n\nSince Roy began elaborating his critique\u2014in interviews with outlets like Vox, in speeches, and in columns for Forbes, where he is the opinion editor\u2014the reaction has been intense. Liberals have saluted him; Paul Krugman, Roy\u2019s frequent antagonist in health-care debates, lauded his \u201cmoral courage.\u201d \u201cKrugman has never said anything nice about me before!,\u201d Roy marveled. He posted Krugman\u2019s praise on Facebook, with the comment \u201cHell has frozen over.\u201d\n\nOn the right, Roy has encountered more resistance. Interviewing Roy on the conservative Ricochet Podcast, Peter Robinson, a Reagan speechwriter, accused him of naively adopting the left\u2019s critique of the right, and using the GOP\u2019s hateful fringe to tar its decent mainstream. \u201cNow it is apparently the popular thing on our side to say [to the left], \u2018\u2026 You\u2019ve got us dead to rights, whoa, we\u2019re awful people,\u2019 \u201d Robinson lamented. His co-host, Rob Long, asked Roy, \u201cWhy can\u2019t the Republican Party have a winking, nodding relationship to its crackpot racial separatists, in the same way, let\u2019s be frank, that the Democratic Party has with theirs\u2014use their energy when we need to get out the vote in certain places and repudiate them when we\u2019re forced to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the Republican Party has been doing for the last several decades,\u201d Roy replied. The result, he explained, has been an increasingly homogenous party that considers Iowa the \u201cReal America,\u201d and writes off the urban and suburban places where minorities live. \u201cWhite identity politics has permeated our rhetoric,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen I spoke with him, Roy hastened to add that he doesn\u2019t believe Republicans are all or even mostly racist. But nor does he believe the Republican Party can go back to business as usual after the election. \u201cThe cleavages Trump has revealed are too deep,\u201d he said.\n\nThe son of Indian immigrants, Roy grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, and initially set out to become a doctor. He was always interested in politics, though. During medical school at Yale, he joined the university\u2019s Political Union, a debating society with a reputation for lively intellectualism, and eventually became the head of the union\u2019s Conservative Party. When he graduated, in 2000, biotechnology was booming, so he decided to put his medical training to work in finance, and took a job as a biotech investor for Bain Capital.\n\nIn 2009, Roy began writing about health-care policy, first on his blog, and later in commentaries for National Review Online. His ideas gained the notice of health-care wonks and soon the political world, and in 2012 he began advising the Romney campaign. After the election, he continued to work on the issue, writing a report for the Manhattan Institute called \u201cTranscending Obamacare,\u201d which argued for a market-based system like Switzerland\u2019s.\n\nRoy never went back to finance. In 2015, he moved from New York to Austin with his then-fianc\u00e9e (now wife) to serve as the chief policy architect of Rick Perry\u2019s second presidential campaign. Eager to overcome his image as an airhead, the Texas governor wanted to run a substantive campaign based on an innovative policy vision. For his part, Roy was excited by the prospect of putting new conservative ideas before the electorate, despite the fact that Perry\u2019s electoral chances looked slim.\n\nEven before his move to Texas, Roy told me, he had begun struggling with the GOP\u2019s civil-rights legacy. He was particularly troubled by party leaders\u2019 rhetoric emphasizing states\u2019 rights, a stance he considers alienating to African Americans. \u201cHow do you sell the Tenth Amendment to a community that was liberated by the federal government from state-sponsored terrorism?\u201d he asked me. Perry had written a whole book trumpeting the Tenth Amendment, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington. But it turned out that his thinking on the issue had evolved. In July 2015, Perry delivered a speech, of which Roy was the principal author, saying the GOP had neglected African Americans by putting states\u2019 rights above equal protection. The speech, which opened with a powerful description of a lynching in Texas, impressed political elites on both the right and the left; The Wall Street Journal excerpted it on the op-ed page. But Trump had already begun to dominate the primaries, and by September Perry was out of the race.\n\nRoy believes the GOP\u2019s anti-elitism has blinded it to the glories of meritocracy.\n\nIn retrospect, Roy believes Perry\u2019s fate was sealed in 2011, when he defended in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants by saying his opponents didn\u2019t \u201chave a heart.\u201d Why, Roy found himself wondering, did this issue inspire more passion among the party\u2019s base than did an issue like health care? Why, for that matter, was a candidate like Marco Rubio, a onetime conservative darling, being heckled and booed for having previously advocated immigration reform? After Perry dropped out of the race, Roy went to work for Rubio, who lasted until March. By then, Roy had concluded that \u201cthe conservative grass roots viewed questions of national identity with far more priority than questions of economic policy.\u201d\n\nI asked Roy whether his own ethnic identity had affected his analysis of the GOP. Might he have been more attuned than others to the party\u2019s tribalism precisely because, as an Indian American, he wasn\u2019t a member of the tribe to begin with? Being nonwhite, he said, had exposed him to experiences most whites haven\u2019t had, like the time he was kicked off a flight to London with no explanation shortly after 9/11. \u201cMy mother is a deeply religious person who works hard, has never taken a handout, and is strongly family-oriented,\u201d he said. \u201cHer values are my values. They\u2019re conservative values. She should be a Republican, except for one thing: She\u2019s a Hindu. What she hears from the Republican Party is that she will never be a real American, even though she\u2019s an American citizen who\u2019s lived here since she was 19.\u201d As a result, he told me, his mother is a passionate Democrat.\n\nRoy insists that politics doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum contest between competing tribal interests. \u201cEconomic growth in America has benefited everyone,\u201d he said. The GOP\u2019s anti-intellectualism and anti-elitism have blinded it to the glories of American meritocracy, he said. \u201cA son of Chinese immigrants who gets into Harvard hasn\u2019t left Real America. That\u2019s the best of America. That\u2019s what America is,\u201d he told me, his Apple Watch jiggling as he gestured for emphasis. \u201cLook around this caf\u00e9: You see Indian kids on their computers who feel just as American as everyone else. The younger generation doesn\u2019t see the world as a collection of ethnic groups fighting for the spoils.\u201d\n\nThough Roy believes the GOP is \u201cimploding,\u201d he has, after a period of grief, regained his optimism about conservative ideas. In September, he and several other prominent conservatives launched a new think tank, the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, which aims to promote policies that will help people with below-median incomes or net worth. Whether Trump wins or loses, the White House will not soon be inhabited by a conservative policy wonk. But Roy believes that the foundation could still make a mark: He notes that what he considers the landmark conservative policy achievement of the past 25 years, welfare reform, passed under a Democratic president.\n\nWhen I asked Roy whether he stood a chance of convincing anyone, he paused for a long time. There was, he felt sure, a constituency for his ideas. But a plurality of Republican voters clearly hadn\u2019t found Trump\u2019s divisiveness as troubling as he did. \u201cMy goal is to persuade those who disagree with me that we ought to reorient the conservative movement to embrace the diversity of America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if the Republican Party is capable of doing that.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-doomsayer/501137/"}, "article3": {"title": "Why I Can No Longer Call Myself an Evangelical Republican - The New York Times", "content": "Assume you were a person of the left and an atheist, and you decided to create a couple of people in a laboratory to discredit the Republican Party and white evangelical Christianity. You could hardly choose two more perfect men than Donald Trump and Roy Moore.\n\nBoth have been credibly accused of being sexual predators, sometimes admitting to bizarre behavior in their own words. Both have spun wild conspiracy theories, including the lie that Barack Obama was not born in America. Both have slandered the United States and lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, with Mr. Moore declaring that America today could be considered \u201cthe focus of evil in the modern world\u201d and stating, in response to Mr. Putin\u2019s anti-gay measures in Russia: \u201cWell, maybe Putin is right. Maybe he\u2019s more akin to me than I know.\u201d Both have been involved with shady business dealings. Both have intentionally divided America along racial and religious lines. Both relish appealing to people\u2019s worst instincts. Both create bitterness and acrimony in a nation desperately in need of grace and a healing touch.\n\nI hoped the Trump era would be seen as an aberration and made less ugly by those who might have influence over the president. That hasn\u2019t happened. Rather than Republicans and people of faith checking his most unappealing sides, the president is dragging down virtually everyone within his orbit.\n\nIn the latest example of this, a rising number of Republicans are attempting to delegitimize the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether there were links between Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia because they quake at what he may find. Prominent evangelical leaders, rather than challenging the president to become a man of integrity, have become courtiers. What\u2019s happening with Mr. Moore in Alabama \u2014 with the president, the Republican National Committee, the state party and many white evangelicals rallying around him \u2014 is a bridge too far for many of us.

And at what point do you pull back from associating yourself with a political party and a religious term you once took pride in but that are now doing harm to the things you treasure?\n\nInstitutional renewal and regeneration are possible, and I\u2019m going to continue to push for them. But for now a solid majority of Republicans and self-described evangelicals are firmly aboard the Trump train, which is doing its utmost to give a seat of privilege to Mr. Moore. So for those of us who still think of ourselves as conservative and Christian, it\u2019s enough already.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/opinion/sunday/wehner-evangelical-republicans.html"}}
