The former Miss Universe claims Trump called her \"Miss Piggy,\" because he believed she had gained a lot of weight. It certainly got some media coverage, but the story also sent Trump into overdrive on the beauty queen.\n\nOn Sunday's episode of HBO's \"Last Week Tonight,\" Oliver showed a clip of Trump on Fox News'\n\n\"Fox & Friends\" the morning after the debate. Without even being asked about Machado, Trump recalled that she was \"impossible\" and the \"absolute\" worst during her reign.\n\nOliver joked, \"You can see [the hosts] thinking, 'What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Don't you know it's wrong to degrade former beauty pageant winners? We at Fox recently learned that due to the circumstances of Roger Ailes' departure from this very company!'\"\n\nLater in the week, Trump then went on an extensive early-morning Twitter rant in which he referred to Machado as \"disgusting\" and wondered if Clinton helped her get her citizenship in order to use her against Trump.\n\nThat wasn't all he said in the tweet, as Oliver pointed out.\n\n\"That is a candidate for President of the United States urging America to check out a sex tape,\" Oliver said. \"Just do me a favor. Look up into the sky right now. Higher. No, higher still. Do you see that? Way up there? Way up above the clouds? That's rock bottom. And we are currently way down here.\"\n\nWatch the John Oliver segment below:", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/john-oliver-donald-trump-rants-alicia-machado-2016-10"}, "article2": {"title": "Donald Trump and the Central Park Five: the racially charged rise of a demagogue", "content": "Yusef Salaam was 15 years old when Donald Trump demanded his execution for a crime he did not commit.\n\nNearly three decades before the rambunctious billionaire began his run for president \u2013 before he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, for the expulsion of all undocumented migrants, before he branded Mexicans as \u201crapists\u201d and was accused of mocking the disabled \u2013 Trump called for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York following a horrific rape case in which five teenagers were wrongly convicted.\n\nThe miscarriage of justice is widely remembered as a definitive moment in New York\u2019s fractured race relations. But Trump\u2019s intervention \u2013 he signed full-page newspaper advertisements implicitly calling for the boys to die \u2013 has been gradually overlooked as his chances of winning the Republican nomination have rapidly increased. Now those involved in the case of the so-called Central Park Five and its aftermath say Trump\u2019s rhetoric served as an unlikely precursor to a unique brand of divisive populism that has powered his rise to political prominence in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe was the firestarter,\u201d Salaam said of Trump, in his first extended interview since Trump announced his run for the White House. \u201cCommon citizens were being manipulated and swayed into believing that we were guilty.\u201d\n\nIt was 1989. The crack epidemic had torn through New York as poverty soared to 25% and the city\u2019s elites reaped the rewards of a booming Wall Street. The murder rate had risen to 1,896 killings a year; 3,254 rapes would be reported in the five boroughs, but only one captured the city\u2019s extended attention and later exposed bias in its criminal justice system and media establishment.\n\nOn the evening of 19 April, as 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili, who was white, jogged across the northern, dilapidated section of Central Park, she was attacked \u2013 bludgeoned with a rock, gagged, tied and raped. She was left for dead but discovered hours later, unconscious and suffering from hypothermia and severe brain damage.\n\nThe New York police department believed they already had the culprits in custody.\n\nThat same night, a group of more than 30 youths had entered the park from East Harlem. Some engaged in a rampage of random criminality, hurling rocks at cars, assaulting and mugging passersby. Among the group was Salaam, along with 14-year-olds Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, 15-year-old Antron McCray and 16-year-old Korey Wise. The teenagers \u2013 four African American and one Hispanic \u2013 would become known collectively as the Central Park Five.\n\nYusef Salaam, left, is led away by a detective after being arrested in Central Park for allegedly attacking Trisha Meili.

The case came to embody not only fears that accompanied the dramatic rise of violent crime in New York, but also its perceived racial dynamics. The case of a black woman, raped the same day in Brooklyn by two men who threw her from the roof of a four-storey building, received little media attention.\n\nTrump\u2019s ad in the New York Daily News. Photograph: NY Daily News Archive\n\n\u2018He poisoned the minds of New York\u2019\n\nJust two weeks after the Central Park attack, before any of the boys had faced trial and while Meili remained critically ill in a coma, Donald Trump, whose office on Fifth Avenue commanded an exquisite view of the park\u2019s opulent southern frontier, intervened.\n\nHe paid a reported $85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city\u2019s newspapers, including the New York Times. Under the headline \u201cBring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!\u201d and above his signature, Trump wrote: \u201cI want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.\u201d\n\nSalaam, now 41, cannot remember exactly where he was when he first saw the ads. He had no idea who Trump was. \u201cI knew that this famous person calling for us to die was very serious,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cWe were all afraid. Our families were afraid. Our loved ones were afraid. For us to walk around as if we had a target on our backs, that\u2019s how things were.\u201d\n\nAll five minors had already been paraded in front of the cameras and had their names and addresses published, but Salaam said he and his family received more death threats after the papers ran Trump\u2019s full-page screed. On a daytime TV show two days later, a female audience member called for the boys to be castrated and echoed the calls for the death penalty if Meili died. Pat Buchanan, the former Republican White House aide, called for the oldest of the group, Wise, to be \u201ctried, convicted and hanged in Central Park by June 1\u201d.\n\n\u201cHad this been the 1950s, that sick type of justice that they wanted \u2013 somebody from that darker place of society would have most certainly came to our homes, dragged us from our beds and hung us from trees in Central Park. It would have been similar to what they did to Emmett Till,\u201d Salaam said.\n\nKharey Wise in court when he was arraigned in the Central Park jogger case. Photograph: NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nAll five boys pleaded not guilty at trial the following year. The prosecution\u2019s case rested almost entirely on the confessions they had given shortly after the incident. As would become crucial later on, there was no DNA evidence linking any of them to the crime scene and Meili, who made a miraculous recovery and testified in court, could not remember any details of the attack.\n\nThe jury found all five boys guilty. The court condemned them to prison to serve sentences ranging from five to 10 years and five to 15 years. Wise, who had remained in the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail, was sentenced as an adult.\n\nMichael Warren, the veteran New York civil rights lawyer who would later come to represent the Central Park Five, is certain that Trump\u2019s advertisements played a role in securing conviction.\n\n\u201cHe poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim,\u201d said Warren. \u201cNotwithstanding the jurors\u2019 assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s campaign declined to comment.\n\nAn impulse to run at controversy\n\nDonald Trump at the opening of the Trump Taj Mahal casino resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nFor many who have studied Trump\u2019s rise to prominence, the Central Park case provided an early glimpse into how his racially charged views entered his political and tactical mindset.\n\n\u201cHe has this penchant for what you might call otherising,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, the author of Never Enough, a recently published Trump biography.\n\n\u201cI think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with law and order, especially white law and order. I don\u2019t think that he was consciously saying \u2018I\u2019d like to whip up racial animosity\u2019, but his impulse is to run into conflict and controversy rather than try to help people understand what might be going on in a reasoned way.\u201d\n\nI think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with white law and order Michael D'Antonio, author, Never Enough\n\nTwo years before the Central Park case, Trump had briefly considered a run for president that most dismissed as a naked attempt to drum up publicity for his book The Art of the Deal, released later that year.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to speak in New Hampshire at the invitation of the Portsmouth Republican committee, using the platform to single out allies in Saudi Arabia and Japan while critiquing US foreign policy in the Persian Gulf. He employed the same tactics as he would in 1989, publishing full-page ads in three of America\u2019s biggest newspapers that called for the US to impose taxes on these allies, whom he argued were \u201ctaking advantage of the United States\u201d.\n\nIn February 2000, when Trump was again flirting with a run for the White House, he took out anonymous ads in local upstate New York newspapers, in an effort to shut down a rival casino backed by a group of Native Americans. Beneath a picture of needles and drug paraphernalia, the ad stated: \u201cAre these the new neighbors we want?\u201d It added: \u201cThe St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.\u201d\n\nTrump later apologised, but his biographer argued the incident underlined a \u201cwillingness to use rhetoric that other people won\u2019t use under the guise of talking straight\u201d that is now a fixture on the campaign trail.\n\nAfter declaring in his campaign announcement that Mexico was \u201cbringing crime\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to the US, Trump quickly seized on the murder case of a 32-year-old white woman in San Francisco in which an undocumented Mexican migrant is the chief suspect. He has since frequently condoned and incited violence against protesters at his rallies, and has vowed to bring back waterboarding of terror suspects. In referencing a promise to issue an executive order to mandatorily execute anyone in the US who kills a police officer, he said: \u201cWe just can\u2019t afford any more to be so politically correct.\u201d\n\nBut examples of overt racism were perhaps kept behind closed doors in the late 1980s.\n\nOne year after the Central Park Five were convicted, John O\u2019Donnell, a former executive who ran Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, published a tell-all alluding to his former boss\u2019s casual racism behind closed doors.\n\nHe quoted Trump as saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\u201d\n\nIn a later interview with Playboy magazine, Trump labelled his former employee a \u201cfucking loser\u201d but added: \u201cThe stuff O\u2019Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\u201d\n\nTrump holds up the March 1990 issue of Playboy with him on the cover as he works the rope line after a campaign rally in Farmington, New Hampshire. Photograph: Gretchen Ertl/Reuters\n\nBut Barbara Res, a member of Trump\u2019s inner circle through much of the 1980s who served as his executive vice-president in 1989, told the Guardian she never witnessed any signs of racism throughout her time at his company and was \u201csurprised\u201d by his inflammatory rhetoric today.\n\n\u201cI think he got angry when he saw what happened to that woman, and I think he reacted to it,\u201d she said of the Central Park jogger case. \u201cI think we were all horrified at what happened. I think everybody basically supported Donald. I don\u2019t think he was trying to be racist \u2013 I think he was trying to be a proponent of law and order.\u201d\n\nFor Salaam, however, the intent was explicit: \u201cIf we were white, would Donald Trump had written this in the paper?\u201d\n\n\u2018He\u2019s still the same person\u2019\n\nIn 2002, after Salaam had served seven years in prison, Matias Reyes, a violent serial rapist and murderer already serving life inside, came forward and confessed to the Central Park rape. He stated that he had acted by himself. A re-examination of DNA evidence proved it was his semen alone found on Meili\u2019s body, and just before Christmas that year, the convictions against each member of the Central Park Five were vacated by New York\u2019s supreme court.\n\nAntron McCray, Raymond Santana Jr, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam and Kharey Wise outside a theater before the New York premiere of the Central Park Five, in 2012. Photograph: Michael Nagle/New York Times / Redux / eyevine\n\nBy this point, Trump had gotten his wish: the death penalty had been reinstated in New York since 1995, at great cost to the state. It was subsequently abolished in 2007, without a single execution carried out.\n\nFollowing a 14-year court battle, the Central Park Five settled a civil case with the city for $41m in 2014. But far from offering an apology for his conduct in 1989, Trump was furious.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the New York Daily News, he described the case as the \u201cheist of the century\u201d.\n\n\u201cSettling doesn\u2019t mean innocence, but it indicates incompetence on several levels,\u201d Trump wrote, alluding to how police and prosecutors initially involved in the case have long maintained the five boys were involved in the rape, even after the convictions were thrown out.\n\nD\u2019Antonio, the biographer, met with Trump shortly after the settlement was announced. The billionaire was once again considering a shot at the presidency and would, this time, actually run.\n\nTrump was asked if he worried that his publicly confrontational style would affect his political prospects. He retorted instantly with a reference to the Central Park Five.\n\n\u201cI think it will help me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people are tired of politically correct. I just attacked the Central Park Five settlement. Who\u2019s going to do that?\u201d\n\nThe biographer was shocked by what he heard. \u201cHis insensitivity and inability to adjust to reality is sometimes shocking,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said of Trump. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that he is necessarily interested in reality as others experience it or as it\u2019s determined by the courts.\n\n\u201cThere have been few cases of injustice that are as clear and profound as this one is, but he\u2019s not able to consider that.\u201d\n\nYusef Salaam: \u2018What would this country look like with Donald Trump as being a president? That\u2019s a scary thing.\u2019 Photograph: The Guardian\n\nSalaam, who said he had been scarred for life by his experiences in prison, also felt insulted. But it was the announcement last June that Trump had finally decided to run for president that was, in a way, more alarming.\n\n\u201cTo see that he has not changed his position of being a hateful person, to see that he has not changed his position of inciting people, to see that he\u2019s still the same person and in many ways he has perfected his sense of being that number-one inciter, you know, I was scared,\u201d Salaam said.\n\nHe was unsurprised that Trump currently leads polling averages by nearly 20 points in South Carolina, a state that votes for the Republican nomination on Saturday and where only last year the Confederate flag was withdrawn from the state house grounds. (A survey released this week suggests 70% of Trump\u2019s supporters in south Carolina believe that decision was wrong and 38% of his supporters wish the south had won the civil war.)\n\n\u201cI thought for a moment: What would this country look like with Donald Trump as being a president? That\u2019s a scary thing,\u201d Salaam said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very scary thing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york"}, "article3": {"title": "Donald Trump\u2019s man on the Hill", "content": "Marc Short, Trump\u2019s director of legislative affairs, has a substantial track record in Washington, having worked as a top Hill aide to Trump\u2019s more affable running mate, Mike Pence. And those who know Short \u2014 a Virginia native \u2014 say he\u2019s got a sharp eye for strategy, eschews credit and will be effective at smoothing Trump\u2019s rougher edges when it comes to relationships with lawmakers. Though he briefly worked for a Trump primary rival \u2014 Marco Rubio \u2014 Short maintained his ties to Pence, and they paid off when Pence joined Trump\u2019s ticket in July.\n\nShort\u2019s selection to be Trump\u2019s legislative liaison is yet another manifestation of Pence\u2019s outsized role in managing the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with the Hill. If Pence is Trump\u2019s ambassador to Congress, then Short is the head of his diplomatic corps, responsible for reaching out to individual offices and lawmakers and keeping tabs on the details of complex legislation.\n\nAnd early indications are that he\u2019s got street cred in all factions of the GOP conference \u2014 and even on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\u201cIn a city where it\u2019s all about the individual, Marc makes sure it\u2019s about some other individual than him,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, which is often in conflict with GOP leadership. \u201cI liken him to a general that\u2019s looking over the field and taking it all in and then making the appropriate call based on what he sees \u2026 Those are the kind of guys that you need in an administration.\u201d\n\nShort\u2019s most urgent responsibility is building the team that will turn Trump\u2019s campaign agenda into legislative action \u2014 and ensure he gets the votes he needs to make it happen. He\u2019ll likely install deputies in the House and Senate, who will serve as eyes and ears for the Trump administration.\n\nShort reports officially to Rick Dearborn, Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for intergovernmental affairs. But he also has a direct line to Pence \u2014 and lawmakers know it, which could add to Short\u2019s juice inside the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about Marc Short is when he\u2019s sitting in on these meetings, he will be able to speak knowing what the vice president would want to happen,\u201d said former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. Short worked as Hutchison\u2019s chief of staff before she left the Capitol to run for governor in 2010.\n\nIn a White House where political neophytes and anti-establishment outsiders will hold central roles, Short stands out for his establishment ties.\n\nShort graduated from Washington and Lee University and kicked off his political career working on Oliver North\u2019s 1994 Senate campaign. North, dogged by his involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal, fell short of a win. But Short\u2019s career was launched, and in his late 20s he and his wife Kristen, working for the Young America\u2019s Foundation, took over stewardship of the Reagan Ranch \u2014 the former president\u2019s outside-of-Washington getaway \u2014 in California.\n\nBack then, Short praised Reagan for his modest lifestyle while in office. (''You see how simple a man the President was,\u2019' Short told a New York Times reporter at the time. ''He really came out here to get out of Washington and didn\u2019t need a palace.\u2019')\n\nHis work with the Foundation provided his first extensive fundraising experience and connected him with the nation\u2019s network of conservative donors.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop him from trying to escape politics for good. After running the ranch for a few years, Short and his family came back east and he enrolled in the MBA program at the University of Virginia, eyeing a career in business.\n\nEventually, though, the gravitational pull of Washington proved too strong, and after finishing his MBA, Short joined the Bush administration in the Department of Homeland Security. From there, he took a job on the Hill with Hutchison and eventually became her chief of staff. Among the bills he worked on with Hutchison was an immigration measure aimed at establishing a guest worker program. The job involved a lot of coordination with one of the House\u2019s main backers of the bill \u2014 an Indiana congressman named Mike Pence.\n\nWhen Hutchison left the Senate to run for governor in 2010, Short did not follow her to Texas \u2014 a fortuitous decision, as Hutchison lost the GOP primary to Rick Perry. Instead, he linked his star to Pence, the new chairman of the House Republican Conference. Pence would name him the conference\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 a role he stayed in from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn those two years he held the job, as President Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress pressed an agenda that drew vigorous opposition from Republicans, Pence \u2014 and by extension Short \u2014 were central to that opposition.\n\nAfter Pence stepped down from leadership in preparation to run for Indiana governor, Short moved into the private sector, leading Charles and David Koch\u2019s political arm for five years, serving as president of what became Freedom Partners. In that role, he became a central player in the political fortunes of Republicans as they made inroads in Congress and statehouses.\n\nDoug Deason, a Texas real estate broker and prominent donor to the Koch network, said Short proved his strategic chops at Freedom Partners, earning chits from Republican lawmakers he aided that will pay dividends in the new Congress. But Short\u2019s role, he added, will also be managing up. He and Pence, Deason said, may be as important for managing Trump\u2019s expectations for Congress as they are communicating Trump\u2019s demands to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI think the House and Senate will have a lot of respect for Pence and Marc,\u201d Deason said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to influence Donald Trump to go along.\u201d\n\nIn fact, early on in the contentious GOP primary, when conservatives were still hatching plans to sideline Trump, Deason called Short \u2014 then a staffer for Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign \u2014 to try and broker a last-ditch proposal. Deason hoped to prod Rubio to partner with his favored candidate, Ted Cruz, to block Trump from winning Florida.\n\n\u201cHe talked to Rubio about it but he thought Rubio wanted to see what would happen,\u201d Deason said. \u201cHe still thought he could win Florida.\u201d\n\nTrump crushed Rubio in the Florida contest, a back-breaking win that would force the senator out of the race. But throughout the contest, Short maintained contact with Pence, working as an informal adviser and as a paid consultant on his re-election bid. Eventually, Pence quit the governor\u2019s race to serve as Trump\u2019s running mate and Short came on as one of Pence\u2019s top advisers.\n\nShort, 46, lives in Arlington with Kristen and their three children. They attended the same church as the Pence family during Pence\u2019s time in Congress, and Kristen was in the same Bible study as Pence\u2019s wife, Karen. Short, like Pence, espouses a deep Christian faith. And, also like his boss, his conservatism runs deep.\n\nLike many conservatives, Short argues Obama\u2019s presidency doesn\u2019t represent any leftward shift in the nation\u2019s politics, but rather was the unique achievement of a once-in-a-generation politician \u2014 that it was Obama\u2019s personality, not his policies, that contributed to his political success.\n\nBut Short also considers himself practiced in cross-party relationship building. Short is a believer in the notion that face-time with political opponents breeds cooperation.\n\nShort counts a number of friends on the other side of the aisle. One of those friends is Jim Hock, the chief of staff at the Department of Commerce and a Democrat. They met coaching their sons\u2019 basketball teams.\n\n\u201cGiven his background, you know, they\u2019re lucky to have him,\u201d Hock said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good listener, he\u2019s not a bombastic guy at all. He listens and when I think of Marc, he listens intently and he hears you. We may not always agree, but I know that he\u2019s heard me.\u201d\n\nOliver North, who helped launch Short\u2019s career, remains a close friend. He noted Short\u2019s ability to work for various factions of the GOP and earn high marks from colleagues in all of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great tribute to him,\u201d North said. \u201cIt\u2019s because people can trust him.\u201d", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/who-is-marc-short-trump-legislative-liaison-233710"}}
